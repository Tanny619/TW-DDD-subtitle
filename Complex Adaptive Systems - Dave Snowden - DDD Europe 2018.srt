1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Thank you

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,384
I think my job today is to introduce to new ways of thinking the new concert so I thought I'd start you off with the picture

3
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,224
This is from when I finish work

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,016
Dismounting here

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
And is called tripping

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
About two or three people dying everyday

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,256
But if they don't take it seriously it's only just 3000 feet

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,912
But that's a territory I'm going to come back and reference that in a minute but that's kind like where I grew up that's what I feel at home

9
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,216
How much is another concept finding a country

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,616
Know what I want to do today is to introduce some new ways of thinking some new ideas to move things forward

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
I want to start off by some thoughts on language

12
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,320
Are you may or may not have grown up with Winnie the Pooh if you're British you did

13
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,904
And you find the Disney version quite a falling

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,560
But there's a whole set of structural throat which goes on on the web of people using Winnie the Pooh pictures

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
My favourite sayings

16
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,960
Have you look at both of these are right you have to be a Star Trek fan to understand the second

17
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,568
The reference to the episode of Monk and the use of metaphor

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
How we use very complex metaphors to explain various complex ideas in Simple Words

19
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,064
Also language change is very very quickly if you look at the left-hand one

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
It's almost getting out of date now because the level of stupidity is gone even before above that alright or below that

21
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
But the actual contacted I from the subtlety of all the messages and all the stories that lie behind it

22
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
Goes way beyond traditional methods of codification

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,592
So I can start think about language a bit and this goes back to a quote from the philosopher Martin heidegger

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
I'm sorry about this but when he was writing I should

25
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,760
I can't change his language to say woman and man or whatever but he basically said

26
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368
Man thinks he's a master of language but actually language is the master of Man

27
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
And the important thing to realise is the language you speak

28
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Largely determines how you see the world

29
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
Yeah I'm getting the language right is there for Keith

30
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,192
And it isn't just the fact that my first degree in physics and philosophy joint honours

31
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,312
Which give me a Desire for simplicity and purpose in beauty and lots of the stuff

32
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
And language is actually quite important

33
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,456
Now in order to fully understand this what I want to do

34
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
Is the comeback to

35
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
This particular picture

36
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Yeah and start to think about a couple of things

37
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,744
Festival I want to make a distinction between sense making with a hyphen

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
And sensemaking as One World in the original

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,448
For those of you are familiar with calverts working if you haven't read that I recommend it

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
He talks about sensemaking

41
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,592
But it comes from an academic tradition where you study cases

42
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,456
I'm from cases you derive Theory you should all be better to be fully familiar with that

43
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
It's an empirical approach

44
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,368
Sensemaking which is myself climbing others comes from a different perspective

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
It says what do we know from natural science

46
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,024
And how do we apply natural science to human systems

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
And use that to create a different level of certainty

48
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,216
The reason we do that is natural science can replicate his experiments

49
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Social science can't

50
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,128
And I'll come back and validate that in a minute just come make a background of the key distinction

51
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
The next key distinction I make which is not used to efficiently

52
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
It's between typologies and taxonomies

53
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,136
Data taxonomy people are familiar with we liked

54
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Put things into categories

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
The problem is that in English taxonomy rhymes with taxidermy

56
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,120
And produces very similar results

57
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,984
Over rigid structures in which the boundary conditions become very dangerous

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,824
Because you make things fit into space even if they don't

59
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,248
I'm a typology on the other hand is a way of looking at things from different perspectives

60
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,088
At 9 going to be mainly today talking about typologies

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,440
Looking at things from different perspectives to actually make sense of the world

62
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
Rather try and create rigid plastic

63
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Patience

64
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
And then we get into the stuff we were talking about in the bar last night

65
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
Which is the whole issue of Max

66
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Models and frameworks

67
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,287
And he's often get conflated or confused

68
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
So I'll give you my basic distinctions at the moment yeah

69
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
A model seeks to represent the world

70
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,295
I'm going to come back later from a complexity perspective

71
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
And quote Murray gell-mann

72
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,183
The only valid model of a human system is the system itself

73
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Nothing that starts to give us problems

74
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,399
A model seeks to represent the world and we see this a lot in systems architecture in elsewhere

75
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
And then people work within the model framework

76
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
But the trouble is there are limits to the application of models

77
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
It doesn't mean they're not useful but we need to

78
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Be careful

79
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
A framework on the other hand is gently a typology

80
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,551
It's a way of looking at things from different perspectives so you can make distinctions

81
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
And therefore by those making distinctions do things in different ways

82
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
And then a map gives you somewhere placing yourself

83
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Have understanding where you are

84
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,655
So this is the actual map of the area that you show the picture of earlier this is the Nutcracker

85
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
Ogwen Valley this ribbon

86
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
You can see a bit

87
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,103
Now that's a 1:25000 scale map

88
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,455
It's a really good planning map you're not going to make any major mistakes on that

89
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
That you can see the tracks you can see the contour lines

90
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,111
No most of us if we're walking there use Harvey maps

91
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Which work on A12 40000 scale

92
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,071
If you actually look at that that's been designed very specifically for walkers

93
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,703
It's got much more detail on it you can actually see where there a cliff somewhere there aren't

94
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,079
The golden rule if you have a walk on different by the way it's if you get lost state of the crest

95
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
It may be scary but you won't die

96
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
If you try and take a short cut you'll die

97
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
I'm in total eclipse

98
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,927
And of course no matter how come anywhere with Maps you can make mistakes the danger with Maps as you become overconfident

99
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
We don't read them again we see forward

100
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,839
If I go back to Rafi this time last year I made exactly that mistake on the top of Tryfan

101
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
Out with that net result in its stitches

102
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:37,823
So Maps don't design that should never taken a selfie the family never forgave me for that

103
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
I said I realised it was bad I fell over on the top and I walked down the field I'll just take a picture before I wash my head in

104
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Go and give a lecture at the university

105
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,367
And took the picture and realise oh my god I'm gonna have to go to hospital

106
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
And then the perfect sweet came to mind red Dawn on tripping so that kept me going to the bottom because I really wanted

107
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
The tweet with the picture

108
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
And shall we say cause some problems

109
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:08,543
The point is that Maps give you a starting point but you still got to be careful and familiarity breeds contempt

110
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
I'm trying to create some basic language at the moment

111
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,015
The other points in this is one of the biggest is.it with architekten elsewhere this is from an Pendleton Julian

112
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,159
A good friend of mine and she's currently actually just about to publish a new book with John CD Brown on design

113
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,023
Working with a Sonic impact the approach to design thinking with Stanford University

114
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
How to make him back that a bit later

115
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
She says and this is a critical point the whole point about scaffolding is you take it away when you've completed the building

116
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,847
Get the scaffolding isn't the Endpoint it's a means to an end

117
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,455
How many things I see far too much within the whole of the IT industry

118
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Is a focus on scaffolding in the end

119
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
In fact often it's the way the truth and the life

120
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
Yep methods are elevated to the pub the level of religion

121
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Yeah I need a allergy in terms of the way it works

122
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
Has somebody's just launched a new approach to business agility

123
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
And guess what the approach is a two-day course with a certificate at the end of it

124
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,519
That's a level of trivialisation we now getting to

125
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,359
So understanding that is key the other thing to realise

126
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Is it there are no recipes

127
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
I'm going to justify this more as I come onto complexity

128
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
And I want to make a key distinction between a recipe book user and a chef

129
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
A recipe book user follow the recipe

130
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,351
If I have all the right equipment and all the right ingredients there's no problem it works

131
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
But if anything goes wrong

132
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
They haven't got the ability the resilience to adjust

133
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
A chef on the other hand

134
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
Can make a brilliant meal with whatever they have

135
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Newham

136
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,039
And the reason is they have two types of knowledge would Aristotle called producers and Sophia

137
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
They have the theoretical knowledge of taste

138
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
And the practical knowledge about apprenticeship

139
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,047
And it's the combination of 4 or 5 years of apprenticeship

140
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
With deep

141
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
Theoretical knowledge about the nature of food

142
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,983
It's the combination which gives them resilient it's not one or the other

143
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,103
And at the moment we turn people to argue for theory or practice or practice of a theory

144
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
And that's a mistake we need to build more chefs and fuel recipe book uses

145
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:29,343
Do what I want to do is to go through three basic bits of Science and then start to apply them

146
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
First is the reality of the way that human beings perceive things

147
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,815
A second thing is how do we create novelty this is going to be really important

148
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,911
Because we try and remove accidents in system design

149
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,519
When acting in the history of evolution accidents of the most important thing

150
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
It's called serendipity if you want the English language word for it

151
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
I'll go through that again finally

152
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:00,063
We can't predict your model and that's what I introduce complexity theory and runs for the Canadian framework

153
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
For the first in terms of perception

154
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
And this experiment which is been repeated many times

155
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
If anybody comes to you and says I've done for a pi projects let me tell you from my experience this is what

156
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
What you should do

157
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
They really don't understand the Core Science

158
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,103
If they do three projects which partly succeed and create a worldwide method and accreditation scheme on it

159
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
And that's called snake oil salesman and charlatan

160
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
And there's a lot of them around at the moment

161
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
Fundamentally if you give it back of radiologists Now Remember radiologists are coming off of 45 generation body

162
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Body of knowledge

163
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,791
This is important to realise architecture it's probably a 3 generation body of knowledge

164
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,887
Doctors are a 5000 generation body of knowledge

165
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:52,543
Let us more Generations build knowledge practice gets built into the processes the training

166
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
You got more reliability

167
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
That's a radiologist have a full five generation body of knowledge

168
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
Are dealing with the limited information set

169
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,343
Yeah in a controlled environment and most of them I got 10 or 15 years training

170
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
If you give them a batch of X-rays and ask them to look for anomalies

171
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
And I'm one of the x-rays you hide a picture of a gorilla which is 48 times the size of an average cancer nodule

172
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
83% don't see it

173
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
Even though the right physically scanner

174
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
We do not see

175
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,591
What we do not intend to see

176
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
We actually only see what we expect to see

177
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
And the scary thing is the 17% to do see it

178
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
Come to believe they were wrong

179
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
When they talk with the others

180
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
Alright now that one slide

181
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
Undermines any approach

182
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Based on anybody observing what other

183
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
People do

184
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,567
Because if you're an academic or a consultant to you going steady companies

185
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,151
You only see what you expect to see

186
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
That's just life

187
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,295
It's called confirmation bias in attentional bias in Inception

188
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,391
Simon is being berating management textbooks most of this week

189
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:17,535
I'm quite pleased about this I normally the nasty going the internet is now becoming even nastier so that's good news

190
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:23,423
Antique at the think he's been generous I haven't yet seen a single popular management textbook

191
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
Which actually didn't Commit This fundamental error

192
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
Yeah they go and observe things interview people

193
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
They believe what people say when they're interviewed inform that they construct method

194
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,527
The good news on this is there's a huge amount there at to be discovered

195
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
If we architect systems in the right way

196
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
But we won't know

197
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
What we need until we discover it

198
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,791
Is the the second thing key aspects from evolutionary biology

199
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
This is called exaptation

200
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,959
I know we had a general problem with creationist will we still have a problem in the States

201
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
Which is growing right

202
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,639
We thought we'd eliminated that's everything and I think is now 52% of people in the United

203
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
2 States believe the world was created in the last 6000 years

204
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Which is really scary

205
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,087
I'm doing work with your boner management teams in Dallas

206
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,463
And I was told I couldn't talk about creep about evolution because it's a controversial Theory

207
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,815
And that's it your boner management teams alright this gets really scary

208
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,215
Yeah but we did have a general problem with it because there isn't enough time in the evolutionary timescale

209
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
The human intelligence to have evolved

210
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
On a linear basis it just won't work

211
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
The other side of crude

212
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
Neo-darwinian night near darwinian ISM

213
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
A people like Richard Dawkins in the light

214
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,855
When is linear approach it's causal approach actually just doesn't work we got a problem

215
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,743
Then with Robin Hood linksmi Gorgon others we discovered a thing called acceptation

216
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
A2 illustration of that

217
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,143
Dinosaurs feathers evolved for warmth we can see it in the fossil record

218
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
It's over a long period of time

219
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Yeah it's cold like

220
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
Dinosaurs with no feathers or warmer

221
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,383
Therefore they survive more to breed that's a classic adaptation linear process

222
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,527
And then by luck and it turns out the actual evolution isn't survival of the fittest it's survivor the luckiest

223
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Something into that in Darwin's notebooks but he says this is too going too far so decide not to say it

224
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Is that to be true

225
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,863
Amazon arboreal species of dinosaurs because it's cold at the top of tree so you get more feathers

226
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
But you also fall from trees

227
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Which means you learn to fly

228
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
Actually flight is a nonlinear

229
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Acceptation

230
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
A trait which evolved for one function and the stress

231
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
Exit through different functions

232
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
I couldn't handle anyway because if dinosaurs threw themselves off trees in the hope of evolving feathers before they hit the ground

233
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,559
The timescale for breeding is very short and the consequences are quite dangerous

234
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
I'm now course once you've got acceptation you get adaptation I was tracked by the bikes not so many months ago

235
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
Buy a tawny owl who actually literally followed me from mild and a bit of queues it was fascinating experience at dusk

236
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,455
And you can't hear an owl fly

237
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:21,343
Because of feathers have involved silence that's just literally can't hear them absolutely sign up

238
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,927
So after accepting you get adaptation

239
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
But the adaptation is based on where it started

240
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,655
There's any design in this the starting point determines the path way forwards

241
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
You should stop at the scene where I'm going with some of the stuff now

242
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,895
At the other one I love it's a cerebellum at the base of your brain evolved to manipulate muscles in fingers

243
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,247
It accepts in humans to manage the control of grammar in language

244
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
Sarah Hughes sophistication of human language

245
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,183
Was a radical repurposing not a linear adaptation

246
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
Have you don't think that's relevant

247
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Then look at what connects

248
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
The Magneto of a radar machine

249
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
A Hershey bar

250
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
And a microwave oven

251
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
In 1945 a racing engineer

252
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,407
Maintaining the Magneto of a ride-on machine noticed that a chocolate bar melted in the pocket

253
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Now

254
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:25,343
99 out of 100 engineers you notice this would swear and have their trousers cleaned

255
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,671
This guy realises significance

256
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
And we got microwave ovens

257
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
If you look at the history of technology

258
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,143
It's a history of x active moments a radical Republican

259
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
Some of the stuff I'll talk about in the strategy session with Simon later on this afternoon

260
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:49,919
Is if you look at it you get first mover advantage by repurposing existing technology

261
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
The novel purpose

262
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
IBM does it with punch cards

263
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,111
Microsoft does it with software developer IBM

264
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,159
An apple does it with next

265
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
After next went bankrupt

266
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
Get the radical evolution of a new apex predator

267
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,143
Is generally based on radical repurposing of an existing technology

268
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Under conditions of stress

269
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,055
Who won the big things when they're starting to work on in terms of Architecture and design

270
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Is how do you design for serendipity

271
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
Serendipity is a wonderful English word it comes from Earth

272
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
Ancient I think Italian story retold by Walpole

273
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,415
About the Two Princes Of serendip Who get sent on quests

274
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
And I never found what they were looking for

275
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
But they find more useful things instead

276
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
That and that's called serendipity

277
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
And reality is human invention human inside human understanding

278
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,335
Is generally accepted not additive

279
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,711
But that architectural structures tend to be drawn from engineering diagrams

280
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Not from ecosystem

281
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
That's the big thing I'm going to start to argue for

282
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,903
Need to start to think about human systems is a complex psychology

283
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
Not a something which can be reduced to an engineering diagram

284
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Because that reduces much of the Richmond

285
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
It's leads me onto complexity

286
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
I need a some of the most misuse words that we know about

287
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,151
Complexity zanotti problem and people use complex and complicated in the same way

288
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,247
And people make statements like they want to reduce complexity

289
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
And I'm sorry about this refugee speak about complex he doesn't fail

290
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,159
The nature of a complex system is it it always fails

291
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
No again

292
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,559
The failure is actually quite important to know come back and describe that

293
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,423
When you architect the complex system you design it for early failure

294
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,519
Big is only through of your failure could you discover what's possible anyway

295
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,871
So let me go through and build on this now build a canary in French

296
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,015
So basically we have three types of system in nature ordered systems complex systems and chaotic systems

297
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,599
Wrangler define these in terms of constraints

298
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
An audit system is highly constrained

299
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
There's very little degree of freedom is very little ability for anything to do anything outside

300
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
The rules

301
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,703
That you don't see these in nature by the way then work more less unique to human beings

302
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
An example I often give is an operating theatre

303
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:30,687
In an operating theatre we no count the number of surgical instruments left at the end of an operation

304
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,503
And jackets the same as were there at the start

305
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,623
Yeah as I get older I think this sort of stuff is of increasing importance

306
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,767
Yeah I know how many people had to have a second operation because surgical instruments will left in the body

307
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,143
That is actually over 10% on average across the world before the checklist were introduced

308
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,287
If you ever been into an operating theatre it's pretty goddamn messy it's easy to lose things alright

309
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
And the trouble is that losing things inside somebody's body

310
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
Has major consequences yes the order is good

311
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
But the cost of that is high

312
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,879
When a doctor or a nurse goes into an operating theatre anybody been into an operating theatre vertically

313
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,047
I've been in once horizontally in twice vertically alright and I almost got divorced I need to the vertical locations

314
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,471
Made my two children were both to quote William Shakespeare from their mother's womb untimely ripped

315
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
Said it was Cesarean section

316
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,407
The trouble is I grew up in a veterinary household with animals being detected on the kitchen table over breakfast

317
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,039
So from my point for your Cesarean section was a really interesting operation and can I look more closely

318
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,391
And I forgot that was meant to be there for the purposes

319
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,047
But either way if you go to into the operating theatre you go through some elaborate ritual of washing up

320
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
What that does

321
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,215
Is it's a ritual carpet of activation is what ritual does for humans

322
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,287
It aligns the individual

323
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,335
To the role that they are occupied

324
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
The reason you don't see what you don't expect to see is it best your scanning 3% of what's in front of you

325
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
And matching it against dominant patterns based on recent experience

326
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,696
What ritual does Easter change their patterns

327
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
So you see the world differently

328
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
When are playing with experiments for software testers

329
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,912
I'm getting them to change clothes before they pass their coat

330
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
Because you actually want me to have a different cognitive activation pattern

331
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
From me I develop this it's going to work

332
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
Into the side of testing and support type environments

333
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Ritual is used extensively military Mart

334
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
So that's good

335
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Valuable

336
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,832
The trouble is we then take it to excess

337
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
I work for IBM for 7 years

338
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,488
I hasten to add I was conscripted I didn't volunteer

339
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,120
It worked out quite well for me I'm still proud of the fact I didn't fill out a timesheet in 7 years that's a

340
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
World record breath

341
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,544
It takes a level of defiance which are here even I didn't think I was capable but I managed it

342
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
And I managed to avoid the school cross country run for 9 years so I think you know that was a slightly better achievement alright

343
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,368
Either way that took me more about bureaucracy than anything else I can remember

344
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,280
I said I take a survey we were in Anglo Dutch company called data Sciences we had a flat management hierarchy everybody

345
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Can you everybody else

346
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,840
Can't we got things done

347
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
And then we became part of the world's largest

348
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,656
Bureaucracy

349
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,752
And the first thing they did was to charges for coffee and buying alcohol

350
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:40,384
Now this is completely unreasonable the alcohol coffee cycle

351
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
Is critical for good software development

352
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,904
Nobody should be expected to talk to users without alcohol first

353
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:57,024
You don't have to sober up to write the code and then you need even more alcohol

354
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,608
Because users never want what you can prove they asked for

355
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,984
When you give them the what they asked what they discover they wanted something else instead

356
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,128
I'm going to come back to that later because also I can text you it is about dealing with an articulated needs

357
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Not articulated needs

358
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,784
That technology capability is progressing faster

359
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
Then uses know what to ask for

360
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
Yeah and I current models don't actually cope with it

361
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
We have to overcome this

362
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,560
I smuggle the alcohol I kept for my stuff out of the office one night

363
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,216
And then we have meetings in hotels which would charge of to meeting space and wouldn't mention the coffee in the alcohol

364
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
So that was fairly easy

365
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
I got worse

366
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,360
They banned us for buying food from staff

367
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
Anybody been in Widnes corporate environments

368
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,784
Yeah no food may be bought for staff it's a waste of money it's the improper reproach

369
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:57,440
Mama by now we've learnt you didn't argue with I being bureaucrats on an evidence base

370
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,792
From the perspective of customer or employee need that wouldn't work

371
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,936
The only thing which occasionally work was the Socratic technique if anybody knows their philosophy

372
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
It was Socrates did was to ask people questions until late or themselves apart on there own contradictions

373
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:21,504
It's an extremely enjoyable process you get train to do it in philosophy I enjoyed it thoroughly

374
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
But you always have to remember that eventually the people of Athens get together and decide they had enough for your corrupting the Young

375
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,256
And vote for you to take hemlock for right so you have to be careful on this one

376
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Anyway so that's what we did

377
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:40,192
So we said ok this is a brilliant move we would never have thought of banning food for staff

378
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
This is one of the benefits of joining IBM

379
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,616
And then you realise because they look pleased that irony is a deadly weapon

380
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:53,504
You can switch on and off with HTML code here inside chats during conference calls

381
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
I'm so they actually think with we generally like this

382
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
I said I got a problem

383
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,768
Yeah I know I C level executives that means I only see customers when they're very very angry

384
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
The high you get promoted

385
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,680
The last chance you are of ever having a good relationship with a customer

386
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,312
Because you're the poor side gets thrown the problems when they finally stop trying to solve It For Themselves

387
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
And give up the right side in that position

388
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,968
I got called out it's 4 o'clock in the morning we got a Vax clusterdown

389
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah I got three sisters programmazione we've only got three three Sisters program is left in the entire company on the sent back to Gloucester

390
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
Define grateful we still got them

391
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:37,024
We got an emergency service which just has to be up at 9 a.m. in the morning

392
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,632
If we don't have it up we got massive penalty clauses anybody been there with one of those other things

393
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,032
I can't do anything at all technically anymore all I can do is get ready to deal with the customer

394
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,920
Stop other managers interfering with the technical people in fact that's my main role to give them the space

395
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:59,808
And buy them pizza and Coke so they stay awake so I can take what do I do if I have to buy them pizza and Co

396
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,184
It looked really worried and I realise they could have made a mistake so I said I did mean Coca-Cola

397
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:16,192
And there was another side relief but I must admit we did start the think about options there is Elstree

398
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:23,360
And they looked at me and I said well ok we understand that may occasionally necessary tell you what it will make an exception clause in the

399
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
The rules

400
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:28,224
If you get vice presidential approval 48 hours in advance

401
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
You can buy food for your staff

402
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,624
At this point you breathe deeply remember Socratic technique

403
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,464
You say god that's brilliant we really would never have thought of that and

404
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,304
No sarcasm get added to irony as a weapon

405
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,144
What happens on the extremely rare occasion

406
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,752
When we can't get 48 hours notice for major crisis

407
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
You can tell there is a chart

408
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,968
And they look worried about points and now you're the Socratic technique is working so they actually made another exception

409
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,808
Is it OK country general manager approval after the event

410
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,160
Now that is the classic bureaucrat response

411
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
I say yes in a way which means no

412
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
They really are very good at this

413
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:19,424
You know that means your expenses will disappear into the Southbank there'll never be signed

414
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:24,544
And if you complain about it your name will start to appear on the wrong list so right

415
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,384
You don't want to be on those lists out there bad places to be

416
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:35,552
So I gather because I would never do this you understand and nobody I know we're never do this but we did hear rumours about friends

417
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,136
Sending equipment ships remotes from our own business units who did this

418
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
Over tipping London taxi drivers

419
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,560
But if you ever tip a London taxi driver they give you a blank receipt

420
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,192
The blank receipt was then filled out for the amount of money spent on the pizza and Coke

421
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,080
A parallel set of books for cat so that you could say to the other people can prove

422
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
But they haven't wasted company money

423
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:05,248
And the responsible manager took a book bus and to actually playing for the taxi

424
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
That became widespread

425
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,904
I gave this example at the scrum Alliance conference in Berlin 2 years ago

426
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,464
Free people from IBM run up to me afterwards

427
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,024
And said we're still doing that did you invent it

428
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
And that's 15 years late

429
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,824
Last year in Dubai one of them came up and opened his wallet and showed me all the blackberries

430
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
Was collected in case you needed them

431
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,272
If you over constrained system which can't be naturally constrained

432
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
People work around it

433
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,440
And actually if that's a key issue in system design

434
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,560
People will work around the system they won't follow the pattern if it doesn't work for me

435
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:55,424
So there's nothing wrong with hardly constrained or they provide you don't take it to excess

436
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
The chaotic system

437
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,800
In my language is a system without constraints

438
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
All-rounder without effective constraints

439
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
That means there's no structure to it

440
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Everything is random

441
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,856
At which actually means if it happens accidentally it's a major crisis but it will never last for long

442
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,232
If you can deliberately create the conditions you have a hugely powerful tool

443
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
Where can I get the working on North Korea

444
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
Where are we presenting infographics to tens of thousands of people

445
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Getting in to interpret them in real time

446
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,592
Enjoying the Max from the interpretation so we can show out loud opinions dominant opinions and there is Ascot

447
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
The reason we can do that is there is no connection no constraint

448
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,528
Between any of the agents making a decision

449
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah if you can actually remove all constraints you can get radical innovation

450
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
So chaos as advantages

451
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
Protects a lot of energy

452
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
City creator

453
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
Most human systems are complex

454
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
That means they have what they call enabling constraints

455
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
And the whole point about a complex system

456
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,264
Is it it doesn't have linear causality

457
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
It has disposition at 8

458
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
It means I can make statements about how it's disposed to evolve

459
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,784
But I can never say if I do it it will always produce why result

460
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,648
Is sometimes known as the science of inherent uncertainty

461
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,280
Is the science of systems in which there is no linear relationship between cause and effect

462
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
All that we have is dispositional States

463
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,496
Not the key thing which goes with this is dependent on what type of system you're in you will manage in a different way

464
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
And

465
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,872
That's collector Corps concert for gonna move on to

466
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
If you're in a complex world

467
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,272
You have to manage by creating boundary conditions

468
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,112
Running experiments and responding to what happens

469
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,208
If you're in an audit system you can plan and design

470
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,768
And Chaos is something you can use

471
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,072
To get new insight but you want to invade

472
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,656
How to say engineering diagrams always assume order

473
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
The ecosystems.

474
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:11,104
And this is from Brian Arthur the first book complexity into economics

475
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
Rodger defining book corner

476
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
The evolution of technology

477
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:19,040
The trouble is that even scientists don't like complexity very much

478
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
Visit means you're dealing with systems Which have perpetual novelty

479
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
Get constant change

480
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,792
I sometimes use the metaphor as a children's party to illustrate this

481
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,704
Yeah you wouldn't manager children's party with key objectives targets mission goals project plans and milestones

482
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
Because everything would go wrong

483
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,824
You can see a more elaborate version of that on the web

484
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,408
That from that we get another couple of Simple Rules

485
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
If you want a very simple rule about when something is complex

486
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,320
If the evidence supports contradictory hypotheses

487
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:56,672
And you can't resolve the contradiction within the available time

488
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
Then it's complex

489
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,328
This is actually where we move into a massive new approach to conflict resolution

490
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,936
Because the whole point here is nobody is right or wrong

491
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,776
Because everything we do will change the system anyway

492
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,896
There's something which might have been right last time could be wrong this time

493
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,968
Anybody's managed to children's party

494
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,808
Yeah a football can catalyser good pattern the play

495
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,856
In the outdoors in summer

496
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,952
But you really don't want to bounce football in your living room in winter

497
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,768
Because the pattern the play will be radically different

498
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
The context of shifted

499
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
Yeah and damage will be massive

500
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,656
Yeah different things work well in different context

501
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
So basically

502
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
What we know stuff to do

503
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,384
Is we look at every coherent and coherence is a really important word in complexity

504
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Camps and Philosophy of science

505
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:56,320
I can say that evolution is coherent to the fact even though we know it's wrong

506
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,392
Where's creationism is incoherent to the fact

507
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:05,024
It avoids that you were wrong therefore your hypothesis everything is a hypothesis

508
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,608
The issue is what's coherent the fact what incoherent to it

509
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,960
So we'll have to do is to agree your idea is coherent

510
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,336
I don't have to agree you're right in fact that can be pretty sure you're wrong but I agree

511
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,128
Your argument is coherent

512
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,200
At which point you get a small amount of resource

513
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,016
To run what's called the safety foil experiment

514
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,136
Been in the complex world you run small safe to fail experiments

515
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,696
Around every single coherent

516
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Approach

517
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
And then you see what happens

518
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
And you stabilizer systems

519
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,144
You understand the complex system

520
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,448
By interacting with it

521
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
Not by analysing it

522
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
Or modelling it

523
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
I repeat that because it's key

524
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,920
You can't understand the Complex Adaptive system

525
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,968
Through modelling or analysis

526
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
You can only understand it by interaction

527
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
With real-time feedback loops

528
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,160
Over multiple agents

529
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
So you don't get cognitive bias

530
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,000
This is going like 101 science

531
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,072
And again that's going to change the way we design and work

532
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,680
The only thing I can say with absolute certain about a Complex Adaptive system

533
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,520
Is there ever I do will produce unintended consequences

534
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,360
If I show this in Australia everybody gets it straight away

535
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
And that's a cane toad

536
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,736
Introduced to reduce pest is now the dominant pest

537
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,368
Naturally that's important to realise it's alright

538
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:37,440
If you have a complex system and you intervene

539
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
The only thing I can guarantee you

540
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,816
Is it you'll have unintended consequences

541
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,168
That means you are ethically responsible for me

542
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,728
This is a big new thing on government

543
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,568
If you do a massive intervention and something happens you didn't expect

544
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,664
Oh sorry it's a complex system unexpected things were going to happen

545
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
It's your responsibility when they do

546
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,368
Which means you want to do small experiments in parallel much faster

547
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,720
So the bad unintended consequences you can destroy

548
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
And the good ones you can have T4

549
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,632
Is actually the unintended consequences will be the accepted moments

550
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,936
The discovery of novel ways of working

551
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,264
And that's actually quite important as what we all do

552
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
Save from net

553
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,360
We move onto the Canavan framework

554
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
And basically

555
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,504
At the camera framework by the way is not drawn like this

556
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,624
It's not drawn like this adding that later just to shut me up

557
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
Is actually John like this

558
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:49,376
No the whole body of theory behind this but basically you don't want a structured model

559
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,680
Canavan is a typology

560
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,520
And in full use the framework emerges from the data

561
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
The framework doesn't proceed the date

562
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
That's really important

563
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,688
If you give people a categorisation framework

564
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,736
Don't make things fit the framework

565
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Even if they don't

566
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,832
It's the one you're working with sensemaking

567
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,696
You like the model boundaries to emerge from the data itself through Discovery process

568
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,768
And then you can use it and that's a really important distinction

569
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,352
The basically Canavan divided into 2

570
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Spaces where

571
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
The relationship

572
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
Between cause and effect is obvious

573
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,824
Access example in civilised countries we drive on the left-hand side of the road

574
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:40,064
There's no particular reason for it I remember when Sweden was civilized until the 1960s

575
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
They had a national referendum where the people voted to stay civilised but the government have the sense to ignore the referendum

576
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm talking about that example lot at the moment

577
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,352
Yeah and I moved over to driving on the right

578
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,936
Is that a universal I mean

579
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
Yeah you don't drive on the left

580
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,312
In the bin Sweden if a child runs on the road in the UK

581
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,896
If a child runs on the road in front of you drive anywhere to avoid them

582
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,760
So there is still exceptions evening rigidly constrained systems

583
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,088
Are there if you have a work Friday that was a bit different I remember

584
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,720
Something moved on the road in front of me in the middle of a Welsh Mountain Road and I stand the brakes on if you do

585
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:25,376
Discovered it was a sheet that the car was a write off and I phoned up car admin and they said next time kill the sheep pants

586
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
Still slightly worried about that one

587
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,288
Yes, had an overdose she put kids in till much later but never mind

588
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm so basically and obviously mean we got it we can basically sense categorize respond

589
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
And we can apply best practice

590
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
Because there is one right way of doing things

591
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:49,184
Remember went to the complicated demand which is most engineering approaches set

592
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,768
That's actually where there is a relationship

593
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
Between cause and effect there is a right answer

594
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:59,936
Billy can only be discovered through analysis or by the deployment of the right type of expert

595
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,264
Get me can we do expertise as universal by the way

596
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,592
But at this point we can absolutely trust the expert decision

597
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,920
So basically at this point I sent

598
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
Amylose respond

599
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
And I apply good practice not best practice

600
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
Not going to argue at the moment

601
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
90% of systems architecture

602
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,256
90% of design sits in that domain

603
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:29,888
Busy assumption is there a right hand so we can discover it we can design for it that's it

604
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
I'll qualify that in a minute

605
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,544
We don't get if we over constrained system here

606
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,848
You get this catastrophic failure

607
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,384
Which is why chaos

608
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
Is a temporary space

609
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,248
And I get out of it by accident

610
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
Respond

611
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,296
The good news is

612
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
I get novelty

613
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,648
Is nothing like a crisis

614
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
To produce innovation

615
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,560
If I did a version is all about starvation pressure and perspective shift

616
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
If you look at it

617
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,936
Is when we can't use existing frameworks or existing ways of doing things

618
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
Then we get invented

619
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,312
Yeah that goes back to the cognitive entrainement patterns earlier

620
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,872
So basically you're saying that we get the complex to me

621
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,664
In the complex domain

622
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
What I actually do is

623
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:18,784
Probe

624
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,808
Sense respond

625
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
But I probe in parallel

626
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
Not in sync

627
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
That's really important

628
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,768
Because if I do one thing it will nearly always work

629
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
You know about the Hawthorne effect

630
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,912
Ok that that's

631
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,520
Cable manufacturers in New York State 1920 site of scientific management

632
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,616
Increase lighting levels and people became more productive that's good news

633
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,176
Pistes de with no publisher book

634
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,200
Cold Light

635
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
The secret to productivity

636
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,136
And have a certificate and training course based on how to switch on and off lights and change light bulbs

637
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:00,256
Then they had some pretension to be real scientist so they lowered the lighting level

638
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,816
People became more productive

639
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,168
What they actually found his people respond to novelty

640
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:12,800
Anything done which is new with attention will work the first time

641
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,360
It doesn't mean it will scale or repeat

642
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,272
Can you get somebody terrible management books that way one of my least favourite at the moment is lean startup if anybody's read that

643
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,184
Guy goes interviews people who know who's been successful as a whole body problems there because the way you remember things have your say

644
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Successful

645
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
Is different from the way you remember them if you fail

646
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,144
And both of them are different from the way they actually happened for right so you can't just what people say

647
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:43,776
Another same time at the conference and did you study the companies who failed and he said no why would we do that

648
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,152
I said we did it when I was in IBM with Dorothy Leonard at Harvard Business School

649
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
We discovered all the companies have failed

650
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,552
Did exactly the same things as the companies who succeeded

651
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Sjsu had a market

652
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:02,208
So a certain percentage would bound to succeed

653
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:09,376
And that's the trouble we got this very lightweight research throwing at simplistic recipes it's really dangerous

654
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:13,472
Here we go back to complexity I've tried Sainsbury's phone

655
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,800
And practice here will effectively be a merchant

656
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
I will always see a pattern

657
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,224
No important thing in the latest version I can have in call the liminal version

658
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Looks like this

659
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
Secrets to liminal spaces

660
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,440
Illuminati is a really important concept in anthropology

661
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,024
And if you really want to understand humans go and do an answer

662
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,352
Topology course alright don't go on some cultural conversion course

663
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
Most anthropologists

664
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,472
No more about culture in the first year of studies

665
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,056
And cultural change consultants will now in their entire life Style

666
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:54,431
I basically liminality is a sense of transition if you put on a mask

667
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,343
Is a point where you start to become what the mask represents but there's a state of transition before you do it

668
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,415
Add a liminal concept in software design

669
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:08,255
Isobel actually not committing until you really have to

670
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,863
The longer you hold things in the state of transition the more options you've got

671
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:18,495
And actually in software development which is I know far better than architecture

672
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,799
This is actually where things like scrumpet

673
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:27,711
Because they are linear iterations based on a defined requirement with a degree of ambiguity

674
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Therefore we're going to explore it

675
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,111
That's the trouble we eliminate ambiguity too early on

676
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,183
Big V12 restricted set to do linear experiments

677
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,999
In a mixed methods approach

678
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:45,119
What we start to do is to say and I use development that same as I know that better

679
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
Yeah there's nothing wrong with water for

680
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:56,895
Absolutely nothing wrong with Hardy structure processes you can use a togaf framework you can use rigid frameworks

681
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
You know exactly what you got to deliver you know the resource with an acceptable time friends why would you not take a waterfall approach

682
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,159
Am I working with telstra on this and telstra just gonna go

683
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,231
Therefore nobody got promoted unless they were Roger

684
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,559
So the waterfall guys rang one year sprint

685
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,959
So they could say they would really add you alright

686
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,031
That's what the thing is very very Common

687
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,079
Human beings a candy

688
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,871
You can't just the way the is language

689
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
I'm over here

690
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,015
One of the Big Things We Lost in architecture and I'll swear to concept

691
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
The time boxers

692
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,599
A2B got obsessed with two week time boxers

693
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:42,207
Certainly when I was involved in architect in last decision support systems

694
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
We will play around with three months

695
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,071
With a guaranteed delivery at the end of three months

696
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,911
But we very resource or weed very delivery

697
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
To meet the date

698
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,823
I actually gave us a lot of flexibility and definition phase and people looking like forgotten that stuff

699
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
Was it created the rights of the focus

700
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:06,271
Over here we're experimenting with radically different approaches and I'll just mention three of them

701
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
At this point

702
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,135
When is winter starting to look at an articulated needs

703
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
Before we even get

704
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
The design of any type

705
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,935
What we need to do is to surface the an articulated needs the things that people don't yet know they what they want

706
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,495
So when the ways we do that

707
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,591
Is we get people to interpret all of their technologies into Watts

708
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,383
Call obstruction metadata

709
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,527
We capture continuous narratives from users about day today for stations about their work

710
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,855
And then we merge the two databases together

711
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,391
Can we look at clusters

712
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,695
Abuser anecdotes with technology

713
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,255
Inside one of those come together

714
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,303
And that gives us novel ideas

715
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,399
He actually did this with Philips lighting

716
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:58,495
Yeah taking all of the technology capability customer stories

717
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
Putting the two together

718
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:03,615
Five clusters three of which became multi million dollar businesses

719
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:08,991
Is what you're doing is you're forcing accepted moments or insights

720
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:13,599
By moving up to a level of abstraction remember I started this on language

721
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,183
Ok if you don't know it we learn to paint

722
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,231
Before we learn to speak

723
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Is a species

724
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,607
Art comes before language in human evolution

725
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:31,007
And it turns out that has major evolution invented you was an accident when it happened

726
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,335
Somebody sketch some pictures on a wall it can like work for the hunt

727
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
But then it started to really work

728
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,199
But if you move up a level of abstraction

729
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,015
You make connections in completely novel works

730
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,319
Engineers

731
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,367
Actually I musicians

732
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,951
Will tell you they have their best problem solving capability

733
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
When they play music

734
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,327
Art is critical to human invention

735
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,399
It's where the problem is Stem education is really scary

736
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,727
Because we reducing human beings down to the level of Aon

737
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:07,359
Hannah Stephanie doing this is about to start with University of California San Diego

738
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,431
And this is actually much more about infrastructure management

739
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,991
If you come to the university to do computing

740
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:17,855
You have to phone 0300 with somebody from the humanities and somebody from the pure sciences

741
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,671
When you're given pass by the University of Leeds 3 months

742
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,815
What we're doing is building across silent network of people who focus on a task

743
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,399
So that we can bring things together in novel unexpected ways

744
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,031
And a lot of this is about creating an architecture for Discovery

745
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,103
Raven trading architectures deliver

746
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
What people have asked for

747
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,711
Did you get the discovery architecture right

748
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,759
The recipe comes a lot easier

749
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,831
Because you got actually more structure in terms of the way you work

750
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,951
I could go on and that but there's a lot more material that was I can move onto

751
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,767
Keeping I want to finish office it's question and modelling

752
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,351
Are you a fine people in complexity Theory

753
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,679
This is what I call the computational complexity guys

754
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,983
My field is cool down through complexity

755
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
And the study of complexity in human system

756
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,615
The computational guys think everything is like blocking

757
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,711
Anyway but it's block around in sky schoolboys algorithm

758
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,527
It's follow the next bird max speed avoid collision

759
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,343
At that also works by the way if you want

760
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,135
To drive south of Naples in Italy

761
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:28,767
It's a much more effective heuristic than following the rules alright if you max speed avoid collision

762
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,423
Yeah and follow the next car you actually have a stressful driving experience even in Sorrento if you assume they follow the rules

763
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
Oh forget it alright

764
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,983
That's not the way it works

765
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,543
It will be in that human beings on hands

766
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,103
Because we haven't got see how you can predict

767
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,663
The entire complexity of the termites nest

768
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:51,551
Visit genetically encoded rules responding consistently to phone them stimulation

769
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,135
The human beings can see things through metaphors

770
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
We see things for abstraction

771
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:03,583
We can change identity overnight when I'm with my children I'm a completely different person than on stage

772
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:09,471
We don't have single agency we don't have single rules with complex pattern based creatures

773
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,031
So basically human beings on time

774
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,103
And that means you got a real problem with modelling

775
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:22,527
I gave the keynote of the European complexity conference all academics this Edward I speak about why you can't model of Complex Adaptive

776
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,159
I said no problem nobody told me the entire audience will be academics who built models

777
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:34,815
Yeah that would like Daniel going into the lines then that was when I met girl man he was the other here

778
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,887
And you can't challenge get on my knees when the world's most famous physicist

779
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,215
He backed me up and said you can't model the human system

780
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,823
The only valid model of human system is a system itself

781
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:51,199
A map to some extent is where we're starting to go but it's also part of the general concern

782
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
About an increase of artificial turf

783
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Official intelligence

784
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:01,439
This is actually real problems anybody hasn't ready in M Banks books surface detail

785
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:06,559
I am back is a brilliant science fiction writer tragically died of cancer

786
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:12,447
Are you then propose to his long-term girlfriend by asking her if she would do the honour of becoming his widow

787
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,031
Is that sort of sense of humour alright

788
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:21,151
Read that and be terrified I've just been involved in a big think tank in California

789
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,735
General Hughes actor is actually as second most

790
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,271
Highest existential threat

791
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
The humanity after nuclear war

792
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
And ecological

793
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
Change is actually number for

794
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:37,791
When the reasons is with reducing human beings to information retrieval and process

795
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Nai is better at that

796
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,935
And we won't go onto 101 machines and things like that

797
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,519
We need to be very careful about that because a human being is more than this

798
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,335
And then of course we get all the culture nonsense

799
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,943
Everybody wants to engineer if in doubt blame culture

800
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,527
If your pet project didn't work it was their fault

801
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,623
Because they have the wrong culture or the wrong mindset and this is

802
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,159
Appalling science

803
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,487
There is no such thing as a mindset

804
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,583
Is a complex set of interactions overtimes in a series of

805
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
The tropes

806
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,399
But it's not an individual mindset

807
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:19,519
You get people who will gather people stories that's good news we gather people stories

808
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
But we let

809
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,103
People interpret than themselves

810
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,455
We don't interpret them or let computers interpret them

811
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
Because that restricts us to text

812
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,831
And by the way you can write down

813
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
10% of what you know

814
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,975
Anything which is processing text

815
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,559
Is again dealing with a very very limited set

816
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,631
There's a power issue here as well

817
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,447
Who interprets people's narrative is there

818
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,007
This is from work with just doing with the BBC

819
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,311
Weather presenting cartoons

820
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,639
Employees are choosing cartoons which represent their culture

821
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:00,735
Interpreting those on the high abstraction metadata

822
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:04,063
I'm from that with an actually drawing a series of maps

823
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,135
How many reasons does we don't want to fall into one of these traps

824
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,999
Yep mansplaining postcolonialism

825
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,839
All that lovely one about the expert must be right

826
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
Ok

827
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,655
I'm giving you three illustration as there

828
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,727
If you really want to understand the human system

829
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
You got a hand over the power of interpretation

830
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,847
To the people themselves

831
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,895
Does it mean you don't have a room for experts

832
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,735
We got to distribute the property function you can't tell that centrally

833
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
Save from net

834
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,831
That allows us to do some very interest

835
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,927
This example is a dispositional map

836
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,999
And this is actually where we are starting to go with systems architecture

837
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,047
Bolsover things like kanban

838
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,863
So if you look at categories and kanban

839
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,703
Ok the key Concepts and kanban is working progress

840
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:59,871
Yeah not the representation of those who hear the advocaat she would think it was all about Post-it notes moving between columns

841
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
Key Concepts is working progress

842
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,783
In an audit system work in progress is a series of discrete job unit

843
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
The kanban Works

844
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:12,159
In a complex system is a series of unrealised

845
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
Potentialities

846
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,487
So the representation has to change

847
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:22,143
This is actually a landscape drawing from mass observation self interpretation of the point of origin

848
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:26,751
Anything actually cultural change map so if I actually want to change culture on this one

849
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,567
If my desires Stacey's appear

850
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,407
You can see I've got some things up there sexy

851
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
What's a tick in the box

852
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,223
This is very very negative

853
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,783
To move them up there is a Step Too Far

854
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,367
What I do instead is I look at this

855
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,671
And I say what can I do tomorrow

856
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
To create more like these

857
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,999
If you would like those

858
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,607
What I'm doing this is a key principle of complex design

859
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,935
Is an shift in the system to an adjacent possible

860
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,519
And once I get enough stability at that point

861
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,567
I can use more conventional approaches

862
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,919
This is what I'm talking about about architect into under the discovery

863
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,967
Before you architect for delivery

864
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,551
Did you actually start with the start with delivery

865
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,599
You miss the discovery phase

866
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,903
Are you going to miss opportunities as well as threats

867
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,719
That's actually from a hospital

868
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,303
Autolyse answer key Concepts call fractal engagement

869
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:28,191
So the same data can produce frameworks at the level of responsibility of every individual

870
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,799
And again I haven't got time to go into this I'll go to this in the strategy session

871
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,383
Fractal engagement is the way we actually achieve change

872
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,223
People don't make decisions about what other people should do

873
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:45,087
They make decisions about what they can do tomorrow within their own sphere of competence

874
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:49,183
Then the system as a whole torrent extra multiple actions

875
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,999
That's a big concept by just hinting at it now

876
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,559
And I thought we call fractal change

877
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,583
EBay

878
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,887
It's all about multiple perspectives

879
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,263
This is actually from again this is work on the whole variety.

880
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,799
This is Peace and Conflict resolution

881
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:10,943
What we doing here is present in an infographic and when are doing this in system design Discovery architecture

882
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,527
Representing infographics about where we think we should be

883
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,855
We're getting every employee to interpret that

884
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:22,719
Enjoying the max of the interpretation before anybody talks to anybody else

885
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,327
In that space is actually from Columbia this is

886
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
Yeah big one

887
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:34,239
You can see that blue and green see the same data in such radically different ways

888
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,055
Sitting down to talk to each other is a waste of time

889
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,639
The only thing they both agree on his they hate the red guys

890
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,711
Get the strategy here

891
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,039
Is there actually make these more extreme

892
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,879
Will it be getting new consensus in the middle

893
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,255
The other reason we do this is I want to find outliers

894
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,815
Agama talk about Discovery architecture

895
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:04,191
I want to see groups of people were seeing the world differently from everybody else

896
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,263
Because those are the things the 17%

897
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
Who seen the Cancer nodule

898
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,431
Rob and people were going with orthodoxy so again that's the concept of Discovery architecture

899
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
RAM delivery architect

900
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,319
And the final slide finish off on this How You scale a complex system

901
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,719
Again this is a big field but the one thing you don't do is you never scale the complex adaptor

902
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
The system

903
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,047
By aggregation or imitation

904
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,167
You don't take everything and aggregated up into some massive diagram

905
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,983
And you don't say that worked will do more of it

906
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,663
What do you actually doing to decompose things and there's a whole body working on this by the way an object orientation

907
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,455
Remember to going back to at the moment

908
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,295
You decompose things to the lowest coherent object

909
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,879
You define protocols for the interactions be

910
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
Between the objects

911
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,743
Annual animal patterns to emergency stimulator system

912
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:05,119
So you staying but scale by decomposition and recombination

913
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
Not by aggregation

914
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,471
And not bite imitation

915
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,567
Have a challenge for design the Challenge for architecture

916
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,383
Is the move much further back in the cycle

917
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
Video with an articulated knees

918
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:22,271
To discover on an objective basis

919
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,343
Novel possibilities unexpected consequences

920
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,671
Andy bell systems with the responsive capability

921
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,999
To exploit opportunities as they present themselves

922
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,535
Before they're fully now

923
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,655
In order to do that we need to have a sound understanding of the science

924
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
Behind human cognition

925
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,751
And the science behind system

926
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,335
