1
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:55,000
For instance...FindAvailableSeats...it's okay
non-static PP also move it so here if
the trend does not exceed if I request

2
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:02,260
does not exceed the maximum trend
capacity we find some available seats

3
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,569
actually
there is some concept that we may
introduce here instead of that what do

4
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:22,530
you think a location? A specification? yes
[Music]

5
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,440
yeah certain coach at the end of the day
we need to have seats in a given coach

6
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,500
but before that the domain expert was
talking a lot about reservation attempts

7
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:40,050
it's a really important concept for him
so I suggest that we instead of just

8
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,950
dealing with available seats a list of
seats let's build an instance of
preservation attempt from that part

9
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:57,480
something yeah yeah good you know before
we are improving the code below as

10
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:04,319
something to show you
yeah maybe you some people know and

11
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,589
depend it's a tool to check the
parenthesis but it exists G architect

12
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:18,569
for Java or C++ basically an advanced
tools yes it's analyzing your code and

13
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:25,170
raising some warnings or mo and we were
working with ethics Macau etc in deeper

14
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:31,170
yeah and we asked him to introduce a way
to check that code base follow the

15
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:35,010
ubiquitous language for followed along
with the of the demand it's a prototype

16
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:43,069
is not a release and we try to imagine
imagine you you have a team you have a
legacy code and you know the vocabulary

17
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:50,520
of the domain expert and create a rule
it's called your code should rely on

18
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:56,700
your you basically language and we see
we have some problem and as you can see

19
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:03,240
we have the list of program and the
world not matching correctly irrevocable

20
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:10,530
the cap is there so we have to enter a
list of worlds that are part of our

21
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:16,920
domain yeah like train Coaches
a federation fulfilled etc currently we

22
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:25,430
have to define this list for each domain
you want and the tool we tried to check
that so it's still in alpha yeah but I

23
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:32,729
think it would be interesting where to
make some audit of some good...is to is to
have a kind of code smell about that

24
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:43,949
okay okay so run it and what was the
result was a three yeah I I don't want

25
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:52,619
to actually...okay so let's get back to to
the business we have some list of

26
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:58,079
available seats I suggest that we change
that you change the signature of that by

27
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,699
introducing the concept of reservation
attempt so here instead of returning a

28
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:13,349
list of seats let's make it return a
reservation attempt...I got typo here the reservation

29
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:15,949
at and thank you

30
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:24,170
okay yeah okay the type does not exist
so yes I'm aware of that maybe I will

31
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:37,730
rename it also but here as you can see
sorry I shouldn't wear did ya hear yes

32
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,240
the reservation item type does not
exist yet so let's create it I'll tend
to create a presentation attempt okay

33
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:54,049
and here since the method is the
function is expecting to return me that

34
00:49:54,049 --> 00:49:59,079
kind of reservation attempt all I have
to do is to install yet here at the end

35
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:05,510
return a new reservation attempt ok
providing it the list of seats I just

36
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:13,270
found all I have to do is to create the
constructor accepting a list of seats
for that reservation attempt ok and

37
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:23,690
that's it...Maybe return a reservation attempt I
need to I will need to to walk with the

38
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:29,809
seats so let me start off creating a
field let me create now let's be real

39
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:36,410
and that it will be seats as a reservation
attempt has a list of C and maybe to to
introduce a read property because I will

40
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:44,869
need to work with the the seats of that
reservation attempt okay so we just

41
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:49,819
introduced a reservation attempt which
has a property of seats and that's it

42
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:55,730
pretty much so that the fine available
seats now the name is maybe build

43
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:02,990
another reservation attempt would be better
yeah okay so now the method is build 
reservation attempt its find available

44
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,450
seat within the Train and return a
reservation attempt a talk with that it's okay
for everyone said okay yeah so the code

45
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:17,569
is not compiling anymore because I used
to work with the list of seats so what I

46
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:23,210
need is to rename available seat by
reservation attempt first step and then to

47
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:28,820
add the in direction to the seats and to
work with the

48
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:33,320
the list of the weather of seeds of the
hydrogen atoms so just let me fill that

49
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:46,040
three location f12
oops got seats left well okay that

50
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,260
should compile let me check
okay it's compiling is still green

51
00:51:53,260 --> 00:52:00,910
so here what I just did is to create a
concept that is directly come from the
domain a reservation attempt and replace

52
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:07,520
a simple list or seat by a mate okay
what can I do here

53
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:14,000
reservation attemt that's it dot count
here it's like saying dot the

54
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,770
reservation attempt or easel reservation
attempt fulfilled the double experiment

55
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:24,560
talking a lot about that so let's create
a method for that extract and move

56
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:31,640
either fulfilled not complicated for me
to find out who writing in English okay

57
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,040
I think it's it's okay for that so we
asked the organization a table are you

58
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:44,510
fulfilled so first extract still on that
class and then to move it to the up

59
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,530
sorry
to the reservation attempt so I

60
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,590
extract to behavior and I put it into
the proper location which is as a

61
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:56,630
rational let something bother me because
you pass twice the seat

62
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:01,400
request kanji that is yeah you passed
there and pass you actually can provide

63
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,320
the seat requested code once when we
construct the resurrection attempt so

64
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,250
that we don't need anymore to ask to
provide it every time we want to to

65
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:16,810
check if it's fulfill a lot let's do
that okay I agree go to implementation

66
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:21,110
she requested counts I would provide it
into the constructor of the veneration

67
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:31,000
attempt here okay sorry I thinking I did
a huge mistake

68
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:38,970
so okay so I changed the constructor of
the reservation attempt I'll tend to add

69
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:44,520
parameter to the constructor yes please
sir do that and she requested code here

70
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:49,290
like what I can do is simply to keep a
read-only field meaning it's not public

71
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,580
it won't be accessible by the outside
world

72
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:59,610
freedom capsulated and now I had it what
I can do is to leverage on that instead

73
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:06,080
of the one that is provided as argument
in the each fulfill so here I replace it

74
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:14,670
the parameter with the internal field
and now can get safety nets this

75
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:22,140
parameter since I'm in c-sharp I can
transform it and to property expression

76
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:31,470
body okay let's let's move that now I
think it's okay okay so here getting

77
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:38,070
back to the each full filled usage you
see I'm on a resume third I asked Reza

78
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:43,620
to build a reservation attempt to the
Train oh maybe you don't move on the
train

79
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:49,110
below that I shall attempt should be a
method from the Train so let's I just

80
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:54,150
extract the method first so let's move
it into the Train so now I can ask the

81
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,750
Train please train build me or as a
reservation attempt with that number of

82
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,940
seats I won't get a reservation attempt
and then if it's fulfilled then I can

83
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,620
continue I can continue to ask the
booking reference and also booking ref

84
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:13,800
is not part of the domain he said always
booking reference yeah so let's stick to

85
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:21,580
the domain long edge in that case and
then what we do is to iterate on every
seats of the reservation attempt to

86
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:28,320
assign the booking levels yeah maybe we
can extract a method here and put it

87
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:34,010
into the reservation attempt directly
which will be assigned booking reference

88
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:40,040
which one the which was the

89
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,839
the demo of the damage in the exact term
of the domain expert we assign a booking

90
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:48,619
ASEAN's
to someone I shall attempt ok I extract

91
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:56,200
the method what will be the next chain
stuff to do to move yeah move to the
other action attempt ok so we assign

92
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:04,930
booking a falls to the reservation
attempt ok if we look at the
implementation just two for you to

93
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:09,650
follow we take that booking a house and
assign it to every one of the seats of

94
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:21,020
the booking officials
ok I was thinking the same thing as you

95
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:28,010
and the domain expert was really saying
that we build we the process is to build

96
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:34,270
a reservation attempt and at the end of
the day to transform it into a
reservation so yes but I was the same

97
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:40,400
[Music]
idea yeah absolutely

98
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:49,450
good question actually we thought it's
like a technical term build you used to
do it to use it in technical but for the

99
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:55,730
domain expertise it was still a concept
of this realm so we have a train caching

100
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:02,000
save Wow well maybe it's time to morally
have a cache in this application within

101
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,119
this application on the yes you can yeah
- everywhere let's see if it's still

102
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:12,529
relevant here ok we have a declaration
of the cache here on what you get

103
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:16,970
manager then we associate it into the
constructor of the web ticket manager

104
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:23,930
then we clear it interesting we clear it
and crunch is changing the color in the

105
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:30,710
illustrating me that oh it takes 3
second average average of 2 second - -

106
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:37,099
to clear the cache I don't know what
it's there but ok I hope it was and then

107
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:43,700
we say yeah the book English fails and
the train I do care into into the cache
and then that's it it's just a so a

108
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:55,880
cache where we only save stuff
but think about our maybe it was a nap

109
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:02,570
tent unfinished that maybe that but even
now if we implement correctly it's a

110
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:05,720
mistake
as we said before we compete with all
the companion

111
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:18,609
so also company use of same service and
why we cash our topology American stuff
it's a mistake they can't change it

112
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:25,400
and so yes it's a it's kind of stupid
thing I would say let's get rid let's

113
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:35,910
burn that which up I remove it here I
remove that remove that and how it's
better I feel better now this is the

114
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:53,000
kind of discretion we may have with the
domain experts since it's not here we

115
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,210
call it before because it's not the
first time when you run that station but

116
00:58:56,210 --> 00:59:01,250
yes I agree with that this is
something that we must discuss about the

117
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:06,200
strategy without talking about technical
details but saying that we can memorize

118
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:18,170
stuff that we get at that time is it
correct according to you so yeah so ok

119
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:26,410
we get back to the method we get a train
from 22 service then we have to train

120
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:31,880
our weeks of exceeded the over trial
capacity if we asked which it's yeah

121
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,290
if it's not the case we build a
reservation attempt yeah then we check

122
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:42,770
if it's fulfilled or not because we may
run out of seats I see the train is full

123
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:50,000
for instance or reached the next to the
limit then we ask booking a falls then

124
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,200
we assign the booking of a horse and
then we booked the seat and then we

125
00:59:54,200 --> 01:00:00,670
return the the result I don't know for
you but now the method is one screen hi

126
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:05,480
we are embracing a little bit more the
concept of the domain

127
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,250
and we have kind of spreading the
behaviors into the proper location the

128
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:20,390
trend are some behavior the the seats
also the reservation attempt also yes we

129
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:26,570
can maybe now what would you suggest
because it's important to be time-boxed

130
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:31,010
so high because you can improve code a
lot but from some time we have an

131
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:37,150
objective so the objective below us is
to fix the bag to fix the bug yeah

132
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:46,369
concept yeah absolutely
you're right you are saying that you

133
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:51,320
what we can is to get rid of that CBG
zone here and it said to return to

134
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,060
travel as a national turn into a
reservation and then return a task of

135
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:02,150
preservation here so that has a method
is purely domain no string design inside

136
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:07,280
simply returning a reservation instance
we will do that we'll do that in a

137
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:14,380
circle but before that we will like to
introduce the missing concept because

138
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:23,200
when we build a reservation attempt here
we build it from the Train perspective
and not from the coach perspective yeah

139
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:31,160
we use all the seats no notion of coach
okay so how to introduce the concept of

140
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,960
coach according to you what will be your

141
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,499
[Music]

142
01:01:51,339 --> 01:01:56,650
basically the topology is taken from the
name of average every citizen name

143
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:03,440
including a 1 a 2 a 3 B 4 a is the name
of the coach it's a name of the coach

144
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,730
it's an implicit where I'll figure it
out these seats belongs to the coach

145
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:19,010
yeah absolutely yeah good idea but how
to introduce it right now what

146
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:26,700
we'll be over next move yeah okay yeah
okay
but how to do that how to do that we

147
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:42,200
start by what you suggest if you have
the keyboard yeah yeah why not but we

148
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,820
will start with widget test absolutely
yeah from from the train we will get we

149
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:54,320
will check that a train expose coaches
for instance yeah for example so because

150
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:05,859
we totally addictive TDD and we want you
to create so let's add a trend should
yeah fixture go so far we don't we only

151
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:13,280
have some acceptance tests like it's a
system should do they do that do it so

152
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:20,300
we are three tests and here but it will
be our first unit test I would say it's

153
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:26,630
a should and maybe it would be should
expose coaches something like that so we

154
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:30,830
get a train
so should trend show the expose coaches

155
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:53,450
yeah every much this one because I
attorney should expose Cochise yeah yeah

156
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:58,100
he talked totally about it yeah yeah yeah
yeah actually yeah I had even in mind

157
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:05,300
some new rules for the related to the
coach even he first us to fix the bug but

158
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:11,900
when because money but he has some
inline to consolidate and to a new

159
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:20,090
business rules such as we should not
feed a coach more than 40 percents for

160
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:26,950
instance and stuff like that so it will
be the top allocation to to to make

161
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:43,840
so far we will need it we need to play
with the coach we need to ask to ask it

162
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:50,110
but yes if we want to keep it completely
private implementation details for your

163
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:58,020
capsulated we won't write that so just
for some explanation because I use a

164
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:07,300
snake name because we we use it in the
tests to mark some situations this is a

165
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:11,920
tenth apology dinner table yeah so he'll
probably have built a spawning yeah it's

166
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:20,700
a way to qualify the topology and it's
good to use because I know in this
topology I have to seat to coach and we

167
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:30,100
stand sit for each coach so the reason
why I use this one okay so you in your
test reassociate a train yeah okay

168
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:35,460
providing the train the list of seats
adapted from that train

169
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:46,540
topology okay so let's check that train
train the coaches yeah I'm sorry and I

170
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:56,980
hate coaches but does not exist at this
time we need to a size of two because

171
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:05,490
we have two coaches in the train
topology and you can also check that
every coach has ten seats maybe yeah

172
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:12,310
actually it won't be coaches I think it
would be like a dictionary for coach is

173
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:17,500
a coach is B okay okay I see coach a
that's it

174
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:24,000
dot seats okay sorry a size 10 because I
stay every coach here

175
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,150
okay just to just to make it explore the
the what we have within the Trent

176
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:38,310
apology okay so it's time to generate
something yeah okay so you said the

177
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:44,210
dictionary we got first name

178
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:52,800
coach does not exist yet
the same you will create a type of for

179
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,900
coach yeah I would create because right
time

180
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:04,800
so here the train will have a list of
coach yeah and now I can start as a

181
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:11,880
dictionary but if you have more time we
won't expose it as a dictionary also we

182
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:19,080
expose that to read read only dictionary
or or even better a concept the

183
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,340
dedicated type for that but since we
would like to show you a lot of other

184
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:30,950
stuff we would rely here but to loop on
the seats
so here in within the concept or dige it

185
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:37,200
would be okay I've got a list of we
said that the name of the coach was an

186
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:43,350
implicit information part of the name of
every seats so for every seats we just have

187
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:49,320
to check if there is a coach with that
name because seats has a capacity coach

188
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:55,170
named and if we don't have an entry in
the dictionary yet from that coach name

189
01:07:55,170 --> 01:08:08,250
let's add it to the dictionary sorry yes
you can use a link you have a query on

190
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:14,240
sit for the beginning of the algorithm I
prefer to show without thinking ok and

191
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,770
by us to set a new coach a new coach we
also set a new coach and providing him

192
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:30,200
the name okay maybe so we iterate on
every seats of the trainer for every one
of them we

193
01:08:30,788 --> 01:08:37,298
add the relating coach into the
dictionary on the fly then we have to

194
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:48,969
add the seats so which name okay okay
first step second step is to add the

195
01:08:48,969 --> 01:08:58,949
city into the coach yeah just got choose
all right okay seat

196
01:08:58,948 --> 01:09:05,278
coach name maybe yeah I introduced
available yeah we call it can you coach

197
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:21,309
no yes okay and new coach add seat. Are
you doing that for to expose the kind of

198
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:25,699
closure for a person but you want to
make it work and then we can refactor
something like that it's correct okay

199
01:09:27,639 --> 01:09:34,109
okay okay okay

200
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,699
actually you have to associate oh yeah
okay I have to instance at first to

201
01:09:42,698 --> 01:09:48,608
coach the coach is here yes oh yeah
coach Coach coach and on that coach you

202
01:09:49,609 --> 01:10:04,489
had the seats I had to I suppose I kind
of list of seat so you are what blue is
doing is to make him else the data

203
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:16,409
structure and thing we will need to make
a coach a nice place to to find our list
of seats I would say but there is

204
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:23,730
But there is something that bother me a little bit in
here but I'll let you finish

205
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:33,280
I'm glad to see greener I see just
complain I think it's not quite not okay

206
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:40,820
anymore so if you like that
oh yeah you have to expose seats ah

207
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:56,330
yeah you're right
well sure yeah yeah yeah here should be green

208
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:03,260
yeah it's okay
but it's really I don't really like that

209
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:11,630
kind of we add seats into a coach and
we change the coach actually if we have

210
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:19,480
more time there is something I would
like to do it's even to make it
everything immutable because what we do

211
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:26,900
is because with when you reserve we
want to reserve some we get a train
apology which is something that we don't

212
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:35,840
own it's coming from the outside world
we work on it and I really don't want us

213
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:42,170
to be tempted somehow to keep it in cash
because it will be stupid and I would

214
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,650
like to offer the fact that when we get
a train apology it should be immutable

215
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:50,450
all I can do is to work with to find
some information or to build a

216
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:56,390
reservation attempt but I don't want to
allow my mates or new joiners in the

217
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:04,360
team it start to to to break that by
introducing a cache and an estate where
I don't want to be so if we have more

218
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:09,170
time what I would like to do is to make
everything is immutable the train will

219
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:14,120
be immutable the coaches will be immutable
and the seats also and and the only

220
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:19,400
thing that will be mutable which will be
the FSM I shall attempt you see a formal

221
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,820
direction a table which will be kind of
entity the thing that has a lifecycle
