1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:10,800
are you ready yeah okay first question
such question for you who already

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
experienced some difficulties to grasp
DDD concept at the very beginning while
it was the time to put it into your

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,910
project or into your code yeah okay so
you you're not alone and we yeah I have

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,029
to confess I have a sin problem I see a
lot of talk about DDD and I tried to

5
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:35,399
apply on legacy akhada
that's not no result why we imagine

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,280
cessation absolutely so the as this
camera here we will talk mostly talk

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,980
about tactical patterns and lost like he
talking about ubiquitous always and how
to put the long wave of your domain

8
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,460
expert of your business into your code
much more than strategical pattern we

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:01,309
will talk a little bit about it but it's
rather tactical yeah I wanted session

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:10,850
maybe before no no sorry
so I'm blue car I've come from Paris and
coach and teaching and I'm in charge of

11
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,270
BDD meetup in Paris okay my name is
tilapia use case driven on Twitter I'm

12
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:32,490
I'm working software since 18 euros and
I'm also Corgan either of the DDD Paris

13
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,380
meetup I'm kind of upset by use cases
and problem space because I think we

14
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,790
jump too much too soon into the solution
space we all our golden armors and stuff

15
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,810
like that our solutions so this is one
of my obsession okay we have some gifts

16
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:57,240
for you so we have two books two Bibles
the blue one and the one and refactoring
by Sola and voila

17
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,590
so to win those books you will have to
tweet as hell during this session using

18
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:13,739
the abstract DDD you you you thank you
we have a referee here so you will

19
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:20,310
have a look at that as tagging the most
funny tweet or you can you can quote you

20
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,319
can take picture you can do jokes about
us about you whatever and Jerome will
tell us the two winners at the end of

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,609
the shell session all right okay fine
cool all the other men for today will be

22
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:39,150
trained trainees kind of labs actually
so we will focus more on the city

23
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,180
Federation optimization yeah just in
front here it's the model of a train a

24
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,120
train which has three coaches coach a
could be in coach C which has some seats

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,209
already reserved in the orange empty
seats in in in white and here we are

26
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:02,969
asking six seats to be reserving the
Train in blue this is a simple model but

27
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,889
that may helps to illustrate some
something okay we have two business rule

28
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,540
for today for the system the first one
is you should not we should not with
there more than 70% of the entire

29
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,409
training capability capacity okay so
this is the first rule business rule and

30
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,220
the second business rule is when I want
to reserve I want all my city into the

31
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,829
same coach I don't we we don't want to
split families and friends between

32
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:34,049
coaches right simple we taking the rule
from amid abashed rank at our

33
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:40,650
reservation and we put some crappy code
on top of that but okay our domain

34
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,849
expert could have managed to be with us
in Amsterdam today but we talked a lot
with him before previous weeks so he

35
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,430
talked a lot about train I talked about
train IG or identifier it talks about

36
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:00,840
seats coach's reservation attempts and
whether or not they are not automation

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,430
attempt is fulfilled and you know they
also can we find to book working affair

38
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,000
as we explain what is it reservation
reservation failure that's a world from

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,759
the yeah you know the session we have
with it those words were the kind of

40
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,240
ubiquitous
so we will work for a startup company

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,110
which name is Tata
they provide the reservation service

42
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,140
which is basically a web api and this
will apply to do its work he has to rely

43
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,870
on external backends provided by
external companies so in front it's SNCF

44
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,450
so the first back-end provided by SMSF
which is external to our company it's a

45
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,850
trend data basically it's a hand
topology service meaning we we provide a

46
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,260
trend in Australia and we get back the
topology of the trend meaning the all
the coaches and for every coaches all

47
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,460
the seats and for every seat whether or
not it's available or already reserved

48
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:11,540
ok quite easy second one is the booking
reference physical kind of tricky one

49
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,620
because not working with when you buy a
ticket you have an ID on your train

50
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,550
ticket this Israeli actually yeah but
this is a service that only provides a

51
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,670
unique identifier so we can't booked
anything with that all we can do is to

52
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:32,270
get unique identifiers to play with and
once our seat reservation service on the
Left we'll have get a topology find

53
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,830
available seats then getting a booking
reference we actually booked the

54
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,470
reservation
through the National Train appellate of

55
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,200
service through that last train booking
sighs all right in terms of we are kind
of done streams we are a tiny startup in

56
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,570
that open market that has been opened
recently so these are the the back-end
provided by the National Train operator

57
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:06,080
is it ok for all of you yeah we will
continue maybe a balloon can do a demo

58
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,130
of the Web API so it will takes few
seconds to to switch

59
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:25,880
yeah ok so I use postman
where you can see the URL to call the

60
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,889
API and we can see the body the payload
with to fail to an ID

61
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:43,340
is a the notifier of the Train and the
number of teeth requested okay so if you
post yeah that one take a while yeah we

62
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,830
have some same an answer
transfer the first is a train ID okay

63
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,449
second one is a famous booking reference
I located by the serving as Tom I

64
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:14,120
described before and the list of sit we
get in back okay so basically that's

65
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:25,900
quite simple way to interact with our
system yes that's okay

66
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,060
basically we have a problem and this is
really why we are here today at startup

67
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:39,650
call us because they face rechromed
penalties exist excess of penalties by

68
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:46,610
europe national trainer patents is why
every call you met on all those back

69
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,719
ends you pages so that means that
started crossed our top every time you

70
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:57,259
call one of those where the pie is
charged from fees so they were expected

71
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:02,689
to do so but the thing they are paying
too much so they asked us to have a look

72
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:08,149
at the code and to see what may be the
reason and can can we troubleshoot and

73
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:13,699
fix if you have something to fix okay
but before touching any legacy code if

74
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:22,849
you are like Bruno and and I what would
you recommend us to do that test yeah

75
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,539
absolutely
in fact we this is really one we missed

76
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,800
the keynote we have built test arrest
this morning

77
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,209
discovering the the code and trying to
highlights all those business rules so
we've made so far three acceptance tests

78
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:45,319
first one first one is a happy pasta we
have a trend with only one coach we

79
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:49,959
stand sit and we
allocate a reserve twisted and as you

80
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:56,649
can see exactly what I do with postman
yeah and it is exactly the same answer

81
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,529
okay
simple IP pass okay second one is the

82
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:09,940
yeah this is the first business rule we
can exceed 70 percent for reservation in

83
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:18,269
all the Train and we if we ask to sit
and you can see I already six C reserved

84
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:26,320
yeah and because I applies the rule so
70 percent seven seeing exactly transit

85
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,290
the way to response an arrow is this one
I get that will ID but the booking
reference is empty and the list of the

86
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,910
city's empty this is how transfer is
telling us no reservation has been made

87
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:47,260
for you okay and the third test was test
highlighting the old seat must be in the

88
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,699
same coach please the second business
rule and in that case we found we

89
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:57,279
followed bag we found about because we
asked here we have a sorry a train with

90
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,350
two two coaches and one is almost full
the other is completely free and when we

91
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,389
ask two seats actually we get here one
seat in coach a one sitting could be

92
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:12,069
which was unexpected because we don't
want to split families and friends so we

93
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:16,510
are thinking about that is we know we
were saying that it's may explain some

94
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,709
things related to the field you have
some ideas about what may explain the

95
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:27,610
extra fees
imagine you use the website you call the

96
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:35,819
service and you prepare a trip with your
family or your girlfriend boyfriend

97
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:48,370
what's happen exactly it's to to counsel
because I'm not pleased to have two

98
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,440
seats in two different countries or
Council maybe we try it concern retry

99
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,840
consul retire at the end of the day I
will

100
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,390
which switch to another provider we left
control poor experience but that may

101
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:07,420
explain that because every time every
attempt will be charged actually so that

102
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,590
was our epithet ease and we discussed it
with Dominic's path through foreign aid

103
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:18,850
say yeah that might be the one so please
guys can you please fix that bugger so

104
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,540
we are here to fix that back
altogether and we will ask you to help
us in that journey so what would you

105
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:42,910
recommend to fix that back what would be
your strategy yeah sorry we are we are
the ten data service 20 Direction

106
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,250
service on the left on your range yeah
okay we are only working on that seat

107
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,620
reservation in in yellow these are
dependencies we don't have leverage on

108
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:03,820
that actually yeah not only consumers
now will complete with all the companion

109
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,960
we all start up and we compete with
other we need some information from

110
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,240
those two and we need to set and to
confirm and to book to make a

111
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:20,230
transaction with that guy so is that a
kind of interaction we have so in terms

112
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,540
of strategy what will you recommend
right test yeah right to test so

113
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,910
actually we already wrote a test so that
highlighted the bug so we'll have to fix

114
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:37,450
that test actually okay so let's dive
into the code yeah you know what set a

115
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:45,150
breakpoint you can call it yeah that's
okay asking me it's lunch in the bug mud
so here if you just to the side of the

116
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:57,400
screen it's a web it says AC sharp code
it's a high-speed Metco API it's simply

117
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,410
father doing Java spring boots it's tied
so simply for when we request that post

118
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:08,680
on that so sauce with that name we get
that callback

119
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,160
so and it's an emotional question we
receive just to have a look under the

120
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:23,740
TiVo is very simple exactly the payload
or the design absolutely and so after

121
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,670
that we instance yet you can slide to
the left so yeah thank you

122
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,480
so we associate a web ticket manager
which is seems to be the entry point of

123
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,360
the system and we call herself method on
it providing the energy you know the

124
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,980
bonus it's requested okay so this is
what we have test so far if we have a

125
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:53,200
look at the test that is failing our
three test is I kind of acceptance test

126
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,779
we consider the system as a black box
and we send so my quest and we checked

127
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:06,220
it done syringes on the last one is the
test demonstrate the program okay so

128
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,860
what we why we have a tool that is named
and crunch we see every time we changed

129
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,060
something we type something we change
the code it will run the test in in
background execute it and provide us a

130
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:25,600
feedback loop with a colored arrow on
the margins or greens is fine and ready

131
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,900
either there's a problem and there is an
arrow in in red below you you know yeah

132
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,650
a lot of you of the arrow is basically
it's the problem we were expecting to

133
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:45,400
have to sit in one Bo and to be and
actually we get 10 I 10 a and 1 B so

134
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,370
this is the bug we discussed earlier
okay okay all right well I think it

135
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,620
would be a good things to stuff to have
another view of what the hell method is

136
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:04,180
is doing oh yeah I just aligned the code
okay for you let's have a first author

137
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,579
of you let's we discover that this
morning so we have a little bit much

138
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:14,560
more knowledge about it so I will try to
help you to to have another view first

139
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,350
we
we associate a list of available seats

140
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:24,320
that should be probably the ritual of
the of the method then we call a get

141
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,380
trained on a trend at a service and we
get something like we call G's entrain I

142
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,840
need so G's on topology you will see
that yeah then we associate the Train a

143
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:42,230
trainer stalls from that design topology
and on that trailer stalls we do some

144
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,900
business rules here and there so here we
if the number of seats already reserved

145
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:54,380
in the Train plus number of sittin being
requesting is below is below something

146
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,640
like get max raise let me check should
be some percentage or something like

147
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,270
that
celebration yeah okay so eighty percent

148
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:09,170
of the overall trend capacity so if I
respect the the first business rule I'm

149
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,570
continue I continue is a number of K
over K 0 seems to be an accumulative

150
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:20,450
viable here and we tried to find some
available seats unavailable sits in that

151
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:28,700
system is the one that a booking life is
empty we have a property and if it's

152
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,190
empty string that means that the seat is
available and then we can add it into

153
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,230
the list beliefs that we will return at
the end of the of the method still ok

154
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,870
for you so far ok then we have a kind of
stupid for which we will see that in a

155
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:52,370
second then what do we have
yes if we can't find the number of seats

156
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,110
requested but we do we do we get the
answer you know the the answer that is

157
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,850
saying that you can even count reserved
for another spelling around so failing

158
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:09,500
methods if it work that when we call the
booking FF series 3-1 in the middle on

159
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:16,160
the right side and called get booking
reference then we assign that booking

160
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,830
reference to every one of the available
see that we have found so far we had a
bunch of accumulator here and then again

161
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,299
it's pretty much the same if if you look
at me right

162
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:36,470
you know now yeah first one is not
really insane but if it's still okay we

163
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:43,730
owe we use a cash yeah thirsting see
that why okay and then what we do we do

164
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,590
we actually this is the one that that is
making the booking I know tours i

165
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,759
transaction actually it will be the
external web app I would call through to

166
00:17:52,759 --> 00:18:01,149
book a seat if I enter to that
let me check here the implementation
Emily we call a web app I know plenty is

167
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,970
on to call the web app yeah no real
interest in that and if we assume that

168
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,279
if we don't have any kind of exception
here what do we do we jump the answer

169
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:24,049
and the answer is the one dumping the
least receipts we were found so far okay

170
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:30,980
and in the case here what in the case
yes in the case of the trunk capacity

171
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,960
limit as X C has been exceeded we return
the empty

172
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,700
you can't reserve anything in that
trailer at the fella okay for every one

173
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,929
of you we will make a few review while
working on it but do you have some

174
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:58,879
feedback about that so far what are we
string concatenating to create didn't we
actually this is not awkward as a

175
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:08,359
disclaimer this is the car we discovered
this morning so yes but this is a good

176
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,269
remark why do we say allies attendees on
here in the middle of something that is

177
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:20,200
expected to be some kind of business
knowledge yeah sorry

178
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,840
[Laughter]
they don't know they don't even use
gates in that project in you know I

179
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:36,179
can't do that
yeah yeah yeah you're right yeah

180
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,620
absolutely
yeah that is a strategy we will try to
apply with with you we try to discover

181
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:51,870
the domain expert concept it's for this
card we try to figure out how can we

182
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:57,179
improve that because so far there is
something that's really bother me we

183
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:03,230
were talking about the domain expert
talking with us with terms of concepts

184
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,669
can you see about the Train and the
concept of seat do you Trina

185
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:16,860
do you see any other concept of the
domain there is something missing coach
coach the concept of coach is completely

186
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,360
missing here and and other stuff
reservation the reservation no
reservation no reservation no

187
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:32,460
reservation attempt so far so who
already expense code like this in this

188
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:39,210
carrier has yeah so we are not alone so
the ID here for us will be to have a

189
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:45,360
kind of way of improving it because
since we don't have any kind of coach
here the strategy for us to fix the bug

190
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,610
would be to make it MLG but before that
it still there is so much crappy thing
in like that so let's clean first came

191
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:04,230
the deck yeah do you know the name
cleans the deck the expression clean the

192
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:11,010
deck now clean the deck is the first
phase when you discover a code you

193
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:18,750
because you need to be more confident
before to apply a deep refactoring it's

194
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:28,289
a way to discover fix a little name of
the variables for example and after get

195
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:34,049
into the program it's a way to prepare a
mental model yeah you know heads from
