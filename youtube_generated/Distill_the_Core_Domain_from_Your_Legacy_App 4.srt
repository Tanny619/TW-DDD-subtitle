611
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:29,390
and allot CG but that can change another
another over the time at the end I will

612
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:32,960
transform the reservation attempt to a
reservation and no reservation will be

613
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:40,390
material to as Irish initialization we
it's a yeah you have a question

614
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:52,190
sorry yeah yeah absolutely we talking
about bed is of reasoning all salsa
Terra so if we get back to the to the

615
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:59,840
Adsit what I would like is maybe two to
one for sense it's to use what we call a

616
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,610
closure of operation its meaning the
coach will have a method which is at sit
ok I can add sit into a coach but

617
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:12,020
instead of mutating me the coach
installs what I would like is to for

618
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:18,410
that guy to reach on me the new coach a
new Aston soccer coach so I I call a
method

619
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:25,430
I'd sit on a couch installs all it can
do it to return me a new estas with that

620
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:31,820
sits involved but without changing the
the previous instance here where I call
the add seats method so the benefit its

621
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:39,260
to first time with ability for of course
or for passion but also to reduce

622
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:45,440
grouping it's easier to move to move
could cut contrary here the coach stand
by itself somehow you know method on the

623
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,969
coach which are mean you a source of a
coach so if I want to move that it's

624
01:13:52,969 --> 01:13:57,350
more easy than if the coach we're
related to a new type which is related

625
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,949
to a new types and stuff like that ok
for everyone
ok yeah yeah yeah in any case it's

626
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,250
important to discuss with them
unfortunately we used to do that session

627
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:26,300
with one domain expert on stage with us
and we asked some question since he is

628
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:31,100
not here we know a lot of stuff so there
is a lot of implicit you know in our

629
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:38,090
heads but yes you're right we should
have kind of discussion but here it's

630
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:45,190
much more an implementation detail
I would say it's to all folks
the fact that I no want to talk any kind

631
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:54,370
of states relating to something that I
don't that I'm not owner of the topology

632
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:58,990
of the train I'm just a user and and
every time a request is is getting back

633
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:04,750
to me get a snapshot walk over snapshots
through my concept of the man and then

634
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:27,000
make the reservation
okay okay maybe not pop up yeah yeah

635
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,120
okay so let's turn it to instead of
changing the coach here let's switch our

636
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:41,860
new stance of coach yeah make it a
collision of attention here so adding a

637
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:46,600
seats doesn't mutate the existing coach
which will only return a new coach

638
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:57,100
installs the couch okay
it's the same with what with a list a

639
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:05,350
new list yeah actually this session is
best from a session of three hours we

640
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:08,440
have made in Paris with a little bit
expect onstage our left foot forward I
guess museum story with tons of stuff so

641
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:18,580
we had to pick a fight for that short
version of two heads there are many

642
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:26,950
thing that we may improve so we cannot
fault the fact that coach ships a train

643
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:32,620
our really value types so we would go
into that we will only make that coach

644
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:41,740
immaterial but maybe yeah there are lots
of things to improve respect so

645
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:44,730
producing a sure

646
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:55,520
yes to avoid the big issue to implement
the same constrictor as before okay so

647
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:01,239
now we have to fix as it's a coal yeah

648
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:10,610
yeah yeah we could existing code was
doing that so it's baby steps you know

649
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:22,159
you should call this oh my god so time
to change it yeah and to so so that you

650
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:27,739
will be to get the coach to add a seat
so through it new coach

651
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:34,250
yeah new coach and then to stalk the new
coach by a ball into the show okay so

652
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:42,500
it's still red here but I guess that
after saving that new coach value into

653
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:52,480
the dictionary it will be green again
fully new coach that's right okay okay

654
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,480
yeah

655
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:34,010
yeah sorry yeah I was in the test and
the coach yeah get back to the users

656
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:53,119
again yes if you're right
complete you yeah okay okay we will do
that because we would like to show you a

657
01:18:55,460 --> 01:19:01,119
second architecture and lots of other
stuff but yes you're right you're right

658
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:08,119
yeah absolutely that was in the next
point actually we have a train which has

659
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:12,440
exposed a list of seats and a trying to
expose the list of coach but all the

660
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:17,600
seats belongs to the coaches so what we
should do is instead of having a

661
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,710
duplicate collection on the train
yeah instead to to have a projection and

662
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:26,719
the list of seats for the trend must be
the the projection of all the seeds of

663
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,949
every coach of the Train so let's do
that

664
01:19:30,949 --> 01:19:36,110
select mini something like that so
cochis cochise let's take every coach

665
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:53,320
and return the value select any culture
change I just see better

666
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:03,310
- list new list this kind of linked you
again better so we met a projection we

667
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:08,710
take all the seats on every coach and we
return it at the this that's it for the

668
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:12,520
entire train so we have this one we
don't need to set it anymore because it

669
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:25,150
will be a get on me apology okay and
okay we need we have the coach compiled
yes good yeah

670
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:36,030
so maybe we can maybe who can fix the
beggar what do you think yes okay
absolutely

671
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:42,460
good idea yes idea is to move the find
available seats or the bill reservation

672
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:48,880
attempt to the coach level because if we
ask to the trade level there is no way

673
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:55,540
of properly there is a way that kind of
crappy so let's delegate it to the to

674
01:20:55,540 --> 01:21:01,510
the coach so I'm removing this one so we
only do the test it will be red and red

675
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:14,280
green step so it's come back to the web
ticket and as you suggest maybe the
builders are short term is in charge to

676
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:29,080
to be verified and to tweet something
new so maybe we can change the algorithm

677
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:36,460
but respect so I go submit based on the
coach yeah yeah okay let's put that

678
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:42,940
logic of looking at cheat sheets
yeah at the coach level yeah so for

679
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:48,250
every coach yeah so we'll have you maybe
the same thing build a shortened I would

680
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:56,220
like to use this one please coach beat
me also rational touch if you can okay

681
01:21:56,220 --> 01:22:02,330
and returning you a reservation attempt
okay

682
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:06,510
preservation adults attempt it's a
reservation

683
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:17,000
a time the core and creative reservation
at is fulfill okay

684
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,290
then return reservation reservation
attack

685
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:26,250
if not we continue to iterate on the
next coach asking the same thing and

686
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:30,900
once we have at least one coach
providing us its fulfill another Russian

687
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:36,960
attempt we are happy with that so this
one is actually the card I would like to

688
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:46,550
compliment on gettin pissed yeah in this
method so let's create the methods yeah

689
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:57,020
okay okay and I don't really like copy
and paste actually but in that case it

690
01:22:57,020 --> 01:23:03,810
so justified its grain so we just fit
the bag by doing that maybe you can a

691
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:09,150
red green refactor yeah something to
effect oh because you know produce Peter
that I should attempt at the train level

692
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:21,770
we still let some code yeah so based on
what Oh Lolita yeah we have some kind of

693
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:29,160
we're happy code so let's replace it
with a link you request yeah so take me
please all seats where a booking arrest

694
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:38,100
is empty is empty rely on cheap right
string isn't it oMG okay

695
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:46,680
if we will create a method of yeah yeah
and and takes this number of yes it

696
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:54,000
request so here we are projecting a list
of seats that are available and then we

697
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,130
have a list of seats and we available
seats and then we take the first three

698
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:04,890
for whatever number we we ask and
replace this one it does exactly the

699
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:12,630
same thing of the for loop we have Jason
here to prove it you just have to what

700
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:19,190
you have to just to get get results get
rid of all that I think this was renamed
okay I remove okay so here mistake

701
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:39,270
so what we can do maybe seems we try to
missile because you could be more

702
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:53,730
diminutive yeah yeah thing so here is
quite difficult with semester we should
be it's available since we are working

703
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:07,800
on seats so non-static public and we
will extract that method and then we

704
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:14,940
will move it into the seat and the seat
level yeah so move it so here now if you
can zoom on the link us with a light on

705
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:23,820
the streets and we take all the seats
that are available and we take the first

706
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:36,030
number that we need it we needed that we
introduced that earlier for the each

707
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:41,760
fulfilled for another I should attempt
to be able to to say fulfil obtained a

708
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:48,660
good reservation yeah yeah I it's design
choice not good yeah okay so we are P

709
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:53,670
because which exact fix the bug we kind
of improving a little bit the decoder

710
01:25:53,670 --> 01:26:04,620
yeah maybe we can have a tiny point
about aggregates yeah so just a tiny

711
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:09,000
point about aggregates I could get the
collection of objects with on tto value

712
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,220
types treated as a conceptual hole can
you see some aggregates in here

713
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:30,470
tray yeah this cultural aggregate yeah
why is that yeah it does not serve

714
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:34,490
aggregates maybe material actually it's
no because aggregates need in violence
need business rules need something to to

715
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,560
to to
yeah to be enforced I would say ed here

716
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:49,130
the only really in violent we have its
own at the trend never the must I do

717
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:53,600
must not exceed 70 percent of the
trendiest a limit this is a business I

718
01:26:53,600 --> 01:27:01,130
own that the coach aggregates as to as
to to enforced when we discuss with the

719
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:05,210
domain expert he told that that he
wanted to add some new rules related to

720
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:11,000
the coach so that coach must not be
fulfilled also at must not be exceed a

721
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,980
given capacity so in that case it will
turn into an aggregate voice maybe it's

722
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:22,850
a kind of detail but something
interesting trained coaches and sit by

723
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:28,760
all be value types here as we discuss
earlier if we think about the way we

724
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:33,850
interact with the external back end we
get a kind of snapshot valid from a

725
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:40,280
moment of time and we will work on that
snapshot so we don't want to keep it in
cash we just want to work with all those

726
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:49,880
aggregates fine cells so to enforce that
we can make it all value types actually

727
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,090
in the long term Russian we that's what
we did

728
01:27:53,090 --> 01:28:03,080
so that means that some aggregates may
be completely value types also yeah the

729
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:10,430
trend here it most of the case it's like
this message was to it was a one one

730
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:15,340
case where we could have this exception

731
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:32,519
if we have a level-two Business School
to be enforced at the course level it

732
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:37,289
may turn it you're right that in the
long run we do that so so far we
improved somehow the wet ticket manager

733
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:45,179
and the handle itself was a free screen
sigh full of imperative code with lots

734
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:50,880
of legacy stuff yeah I think we have
kind of improved a little bit it's one

735
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,309
screen high it's using the world of the
domain within the code what we call you

736
01:28:56,309 --> 01:29:02,130
bitch to storage we extract some
behaviors and we put it into the popular

737
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:07,769
locations but there is still something
that bother us someone has told it

738
01:29:07,769 --> 01:29:15,959
before this is that we have some jeezum
 design into the domain method

739
01:29:15,959 --> 01:29:22,110
and we still reach our task of strings
if she's also a jism yeah what we would

740
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:28,380
like to do here is to get rid of that
design strain stuff and to replace it by

741
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:35,579
your resolution sorry reservation so
that the relative method will return a

742
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:41,249
reservation and then on the f
constrictor side and we will transform

743
01:29:41,249 --> 01:29:45,989
the Resurrection into a diesel version
if we have an adapter if you have

744
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:50,340
something that he proposed okay so I
suggest I will talk a little bit about

745
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,979
the second equation which slide I'm
sorry

746
01:29:52,979 --> 01:30:00,179
I will work on the card yeah just you
don't see but it will explain when we

747
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:04,380
get back to the code and like an
architecture we explain my video yeah

748
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:10,590
okay
so who is aware of what our graph

749
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:18,420
structure is okay cool what executive
feature is its architecture pattern made

750
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:24,090
by Alice Taco Bell
I can't remember the long time long time

751
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:28,940
ago
and it has many benefits it's a pattern
that architectural level it's an OS to

752
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:40,370
embrace change it was the first idea of
Aleister was to plug and unplug external

753
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:46,460
dependencies plug and unplug stuff he
was talking about whether system able to

754
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:51,260
to be plugged with many different
standards as input and many different

755
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:56,780
stutters as output to broadcast news to
broadcast to to TV to radio to whatever
so it was it's melody was to have a kind

756
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:07,220
of clean code inside and every changes
in terms of i/o or way to interact with

757
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:12,290
the system to be a non-event to me
something like you plug a plug in and

758
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:17,900
you can plug a plug in and that's it so
it's it's come with it was introduced by

759
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:25,040
that idea in mind but when we think
about it it may allow us that we want to

760
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:30,320
foster on the domain to make some code
more value business value inside to

761
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:36,310
protect our domain code from the
technical stuff I don't know for you but

762
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:40,790
during long time I thought it was not
even possible to properly speed between

763
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:46,070
domain logic and and technical one we
try many times that we faced a lot and

764
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:51,880
since I discovered that that pattern
it's really a nice way to and for that

765
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:56,330
and also to enforce testability because
since everything is a pluggable and

766
01:31:56,330 --> 01:32:02,150
pluggable we can stop we can mop we can
stop the input output of the of the

767
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:07,730
systems business logic inside and so for
today we will focus much more the how to

768
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:12,350
protect our domain Khan how does it work
it works

769
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:16,460
considering the world in two different
area there is our inside and there is

770
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:21,440
your outside
simple right no thousands of layers no

771
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:27,410
simply to area the inside is a domain
it's your double code like the has a

772
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:30,680
method like the trend the the
reservation at time the stuff like that

773
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:36,560
and the infrastructure code is at the
outside of your of your system so this

774
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,710
is where you will find your favorite
HTTP starch

775
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:43,520
your database drivers your
message-oriented middleware carriage

776
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:47,110
solution or whatever this is
infrastructure of silence which I've got
and what we want is to faster and to

777
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:56,390
improve the domain code so we have
diversity she is some kind of putting

778
01:32:56,390 --> 01:33:03,080
some bubbles around your domain code and
defining some entry points to enter and

779
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:08,810
to leave the the domain code so you keep
the first which occurred at the other

780
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:15,860
side this is a nice capability actually
because I don't know for you but when
you start your theory as a developer you

781
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:21,260
need to improve your skill you need to
discover a new thing you need to do lot

782
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:26,270
of mistakes you need to implement you
all from last unit in order to realize

783
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:30,140
at one point that there are some silly
stuff like implementing or framework

784
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:36,230
stuff like that but before you focus on
the domain really it's still important
for some new young developers to be able

785
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:43,370
to to play in a kind of playground I'm
okay with that

786
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:48,500
as much as it does not jeopardize the
business value and the project and in

787
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,800
that case I'm happy with that because
there is a kind of location where you

788
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:56,180
can play it's a playground so first with
your code you can try new technology new

789
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:01,130
stuffs that are but without jeopardizing
the domain code so this is what I really

790
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:05,719
like in that in that pattern so how does
it work because there are okay Barbara's

791
01:34:05,719 --> 01:34:09,560
but I need to enter two and to leave the
building I would say that to leave the

792
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,880
domain code so to do so in terms of
dependencies all dependencies are

793
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,330
towards inside believe the
infrastructure code is aware of can

794
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:22,489
reference domain code but of course the
main code should not be aware at all any

795
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:29,110
framework even Jesus toughest it seemed
like that so the domain is completely

796
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:36,770
independent from any kind of technology
even jeezum string or thing like that so

797
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:42,800
to do so to allow to us to move from the
inside to the outside to ask new thing

798
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,870
to talk with external web api and do
some stuff we will rely on post and

799
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:53,180
editors and to do sort of we actually
use

800
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:58,160
dependency inversion principle so that
from the inside we can go outside and do

801
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:04,130
some stuff at least Taco Bell recently
discussed with a new another guy I can't

802
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:07,910
remember the name and that was
suggesting the name of configurable

803
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:12,920
dependencies what Alistair was saying is
dependency injection passive and I don't

804
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,840
really like because this is like if
negative way of formulating things it's

805
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:23,900
you used to do that do the other way
around do the inverse so he was trying
to find a much more fluent intention way

806
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:32,660
of saying that so their leaders to
configurable dependencies so you plug

807
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:41,420
and unplug your dependencies run the
other main so if we get back to a case

808
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:47,420
here we say we have passed another tough
to enter and to leave the Z domain so

809
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:52,550
ports belongs to the domain and there
are some interfaces like lollipops here

810
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:57,440
so here I've got the I have seats which
is the entry point from the from the
transfer system so I had through an

811
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:07,340
adapter HTTP adapter IP dot net callback
I must call an interface which is a port

812
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:14,930
I another seat say please mate reserved
meal rather me something and I get a

813
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:19,190
reservation and that adapter will do the
rotation between the reservation and the
generation because he's Jesus that so it

814
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:29,840
will be the proper location to do so
when I need to form a business school

815
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,090
when I need some extra data some extra
thing if not provided by everything I

816
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:41,270
need from the beginning there are many
ways to do that but if let say I need to

817
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:47,390
ask one of the external
SNCF dependency you know the three web

818
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:52,160
api we call during the process we need
two exits we need to add something to
the outside so to do so we asked some

819
01:36:54,940 --> 01:37:00,680
ports also made from the inside there is
a iBooks it interface there is I provide

820
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:05,840
trained topology interface and there is
I get booking reference interface these

821
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,270
are
domaine interface the the post still

822
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:14,010
belongs to the domain reason why the
lollipop is in blue

823
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:17,970
but the adapter is what belongs to Z
alpha structure

824
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:22,170
so basically rather turns something that
maps between the first Witcher code to

825
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:28,620
the domain one and vice-versa mr. K for
all of you yeah we'll see that in

826
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:36,060
recording in a few minutes so post an
adapter to go into God easy right okay

827
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:40,650
but when we try to implement it the
first time there's tons of question that
arouse and there are many ways to to to

828
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:50,880
do so so we'll show you one we have to
initialize we are twin it to initialize

829
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:59,520
eight to initiate you had to build you
have to build the stuff so I like I've

830
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,670
got a metaphor which is a keyring
metaphor to him to explain that to my

831
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:07,710
mate I try to explain to you first step
its we will talk here about the

832
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:11,700
composition of utopian application you
know the the place on your application

833
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:17,070
where you build all your dependencies
and then voila apply the system is able

834
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:22,320
to work and to do is work okay so we're
talking about the bootstrap of your

835
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:27,000
application here so three steps first
step is to Austin said I need to go out

836
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,760
adapters all the adapters to go to ask
to the SNCF back cam please give me a

837
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:36,360
topology please
so here are represented to send data
service adapter and booking a service

838
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:44,460
adapter these are like cheese to go
outside and to ask stuff so first step

839
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:49,980
is translate those keys then second step
is I've got those kids I wrapped them
with your executive I wrapped them with

840
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:57,330
the the domain the the exact one is
where the domain stem so it's a web to

841
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:01,440
get manager so the web ticket manager
will receive within its console tones

842
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:09,930
epochs interface to interact with the
extent I won and then whilst on set we

843
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:14,400
wrapped the exact goal with a new
adapter which will be the adapter to be
used in order to interior into to

844
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:22,890
interact with our system so it's I need
- I need to enter that it's the way to

845
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:27,660
communicate with our application but
once we do that all we have to keep in
our head from an application perspective

846
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:35,070
from the asp.net Web API perspective all
I have to keep in my hand will be Z and

847
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:39,540
three point adapter
so although the rest of the exact rule

848
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:46,590
and adapters it's an implementation
details once I've built the place all I

849
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:51,660
have to keep from our Web API
perspective is that adapter which is the

850
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:58,110
entry point from a formal system okay to
put it differently those three steps

851
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:04,199
looking at that diagram first we install
set the adapter we need to go out so V

852
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:07,980
for the three back ends then we wrap
them with Zigzagoon

853
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:13,440
whereas domain logic stands and then we
wrap that domain logic it's like Russian

854
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:18,000
doll you know I need to go out the exact
goal I need to go in and at the end of

855
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,660
the day all you keep in your hands - I
need to go in this is the only thing

856
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:26,270
that you need to interact with the with
a system from a reputation perspective

857
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:30,960
so all you keep in your line will be
only that adapter that you will inject

858
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:38,489
into your callback I speed up the
corners and stuff like that okay sure
you have some question we will call it

859
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:51,440
or hope you will have some questions so
just to have a look on the new version

860
01:40:51,440 --> 01:41:00,080
you can notice now we have a reservation
and the modification has been to call a

861
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:09,410
confirm because after this line I know
there is no exception and I can return

862
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:16,230
the reservation so the did the
modification of the test desire yeah we

863
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:23,429
returned a reservation and I already
create a beginning of adapter the output

864
01:41:23,429 --> 01:41:31,380
adapter with adapt reservation this this
this function will be called by Tomas in

865
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:35,199
two minutes so you start to move
the technical design annotation to the
proper place exactly okay what I suggest

866
01:41:38,469 --> 01:41:44,499
is to for me to to reduce in that first
acceptance test what I will have to do

867
01:41:44,499 --> 01:41:53,229
into my bootstrap my composition route
okay so first one is to step one is two

868
01:41:53,229 --> 01:41:58,539
instances I want to go out adapter so
here ten data service for instance we
can even rico and rename it and sorry

869
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:05,949
senator it's a bad name it's not the
service that's obviously I was there

870
01:42:05,949 --> 01:42:14,439
it's a proxy to and same thing for for
that adapter okay step one I instantiate

871
01:42:14,439 --> 01:42:17,349
the dependencies I need to go to the
outside world

872
01:42:17,349 --> 01:42:24,489
yeah all right then what I need is to
associate the exact good actually so the
exact on here is a web ticket manager so

873
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:35,260
let's call it exact only here for
pedagogical school perspective over your

874
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:41,039
life you don't you will call it with a
business name so please don't tell Eric
that we did that but just it's to focus

875
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,999
on the executor has to take you up on
topic it's better for me to to rename it

876
01:42:48,999 --> 01:42:53,349
exact one here and then instead of
calling directly the egregore

877
01:42:53,349 --> 01:42:58,719
all I have said before is the
application we would have to interact

878
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:01,599
with my my business logic through an
adapter yeah

879
01:43:01,599 --> 01:43:06,939
so let's introduce hit yeah step 3
introduced D I want to go in a raptor so

880
01:43:06,939 --> 01:43:13,269
here but I can do is to how can we
generation oh yeah oh yeah you already

881
01:43:13,269 --> 01:43:20,409
came same name same name so I will
instantiate it providing what should I
provide okay I think I got a sense like

882
01:43:25,059 --> 01:43:30,159
Russian dolls so those two first we are
providing to the exact goal here and the
exact one is provided to the to the to

883
01:43:32,829 --> 01:43:39,189
the guy okay so I create a constructor
because so far you just had made a

884
01:43:39,189 --> 01:43:44,709
static functions okay maybe you have to
make an abstraction
not to inject what ticket manager yes

885
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:53,590
actually yes you're right we talked
about personnel at the ports are like

886
01:43:53,590 --> 01:44:00,429
interfaces so what I can do maybe is on
the web ticket manager here it's

887
01:44:00,429 --> 01:44:06,670
introducing its we changed after so
let's create an interface for that and

888
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:20,170
let's say I reserve seats don't you like
that no it's sorry I I used to walk in

889
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:25,300
on a Mac so we try to pick a key border
to reservations it a lot

890
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:33,039
I was assets you work every day let me
see yes I reserved seats I tried to find

891
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:44,729
Susan as a stress yeah so I asked I add
the resume turd on that interface I go

892
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:49,929
here this is a port this is a port in
order to enter the exact word what I

893
01:44:49,929 --> 01:44:56,559
mean so getting back to the code here
what I will provide to the external

894
01:44:56,559 --> 01:45:04,150
adapter it will be the exact one but as
rubs go to implementation as charlie
reserved seats yeah I resisted

895
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:16,150
okay let me keep it into a private field
here I will need it so I start set a

896
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:22,689
reservation adapter okay so self step to
associate other nationality let's

897
01:45:22,689 --> 01:45:29,469
introduce a variable for that with our
instance okay my idea will be to replace

898
01:45:29,469 --> 01:45:34,959
the direct call to the exact code by
something going through the adapter you

899
01:45:34,959 --> 01:45:40,539
know so just to make it compile I will
go to the controller to web controller

900
01:45:40,539 --> 01:45:46,479
which is the place where I will use that
exact same adapter so in that column

901
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:53,079
here I will need to my entry point will
be together reservation request dto so I
will get a reservation request it you

902
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:59,710
give it to the adapter and the other
we'll get back to me with a diesel

903
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:06,590
relating to the reservation okay so to
do so I think the duration DT o is not

904
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:11,420
in the proper place I won't be able to
refuse it from the from the test yeah so

905
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:16,580
I suggest that we move that and maybe it
will be no envision is quite painful to

906
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:21,830
create project it's long so I will just
create a directories here I will create

907
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:25,850
returned that domain all right and
hundred aha

908
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:33,620
so that we can start to split infra
infrastructure and ha okay so that we
can we are able to speak properly every

909
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:43,190
type into the proper location I'd moved
typed into matching files for be sure
that every file match to type so booking

910
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:53,090
a national service where should I put
the manner of hot-looking referral

911
01:46:53,090 --> 01:47:02,200
service it's a bad name nom label the
name will be different but yeah coach

912
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:11,600
domain yeah booking service i domain
yeah it's an interface so it's support

913
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:20,570
yeah actually here so domain yeah I
reserved seats support support so the
mainly yeah

914
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:29,090
I trained that I service its names but
it's a domain is it okay its interface

915
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:35,860
yeah reservation domain domain rights
reserved I shall attempt same
reservation hotel for you same

916
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:43,820
reservation failure also it's it's a
divine
actually it's much more something to

917
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:49,340
implement the biggest law where there is
no added value more than twelve toppling

918
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:55,430
seats the main main I'm kind of happy
because you have more domains than the

919
01:47:55,430 --> 01:48:02,740
France feature which is not the case in
all my projects so far so citizen poco

920
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:10,280
sips reservation adapter adapter is part
of the infrastructure yeah solutely

921
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:15,060
trestle
capacity domain absolutely even if we

922
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:24,030
came in through the name trailer is it
the main and what do we have time data
service of course which is another time

923
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:36,450
and when ticket manager domain it it's
all exactly but so far it's seen as some

924
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:45,480
to HTTP rationale that we get rid no
it's okay so let's put it to the let's

925
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:48,230
keep it in the middle

926
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:54,390
let's keep it into the middle before we
completely clean the house and put it in

927
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:57,930
2009 Chester namespace
sorry I just enhancement yeah I would

928
01:48:57,930 --> 01:49:03,060
adjust the namespace here for this for
the project so that everyone would be at

929
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:16,080
the proper location okay so what I was
saying is I will from the should Cochran
system should getting back to the test

930
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,620
okay
I said that I would like to introduce a

931
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:28,680
way to interact with the resolution
adapter so let's let's say it's a it's

932
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:34,440
supposed to do there is a better name to
find but new reservation request
diffuses I don't know if you you move it

933
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:43,530
I don't know I didn't move thanks below
so reservation request did you hear I

934
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:54,390
have to move is it's on the bad project
move to folder next nation for you okay

935
01:49:54,390 --> 01:50:00,360
so now I will be able to reference it
from the test otherwise it will be part
of the Web API which has no reference so

936
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:10,290
far okay so we here I will instantiate a
new reservation request DT oh this is HP

937
01:50:10,290 --> 01:50:16,290
detector Bob which used to instantiate
that for me but our number of seats here

938
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:23,530
will be it sits requested counts and
then the other

939
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:29,890
train ID so here I'm setting the
equivalent of the design we receive as

940
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:33,520
the input
it's a poco for a fight and it will be

941
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:42,570
trained AG here is my train
yeah okay so here I passed a new
requested yo maybe this thing's let's

942
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:56,020
make it viable to make it clean so I've
got a request it you okay and then I

943
01:50:56,020 --> 01:51:01,240
pass the reservation request did you to
see to the adapter yeah I want to go in
a laptop great method okay create the

944
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:11,200
method and instead of returning void I
will return maybe a string which will be

945
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:17,710
the design I mean I can hear I can
return something much more like I speed

946
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:21,940
up net internal structure to make a
response but I won't go into that here

947
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:29,640
but as I rationalize it you okay
so here I am in the posts method yeah

948
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:36,390
that should we tell me the reason a
visual reservation something like that

949
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:40,390
why not
yeah so the adapter will return me that

950
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:46,260
and I will ascertain on that yeah so
instead of all that

951
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:51,940
general direction should be equal to
that Jesus that objective to target you

952
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:56,740
know that yeah so it's still right
because I didn't plug the janitor so

953
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:03,160
another term has three steps to
instantiate the entire exact on a stick

954
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:09,480
you but when I mean every method of the
other term of three step basically its

955
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:13,440
first step is to adapt from their first
ratio to the domain

956
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:18,190
second step is to call the business
logic and then the third step is to

957
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:23,800
adapt from domain answer to Z
infrastructure and to return it yeah you

958
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:29,860
know what is it about in every method of
adapter so let's make it here in that
case I don't have to adapt

959
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:34,679
here so I will just introduce a new
variable

960
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:40,800
for the number of seats and with a
machine liquid in the way your life

961
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:47,640
maybe you you have to sterilize yourself
and we simulate this tech because I spin

962
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:53,040
and do that for for us that sometimes
you have to translate the design in

963
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:59,820
local viable for a domain object so here
what I just did is to get some variables

964
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:04,500
but this is where you will have to
translate transform adjust whatever it

965
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:10,110
takes to to to be able to call the
domain logic yeah God so now I call the

966
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:16,679
exact room so exactly not reserved it's
a business domain Mossad and I put it

967
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:23,640
tonight local variable I get and number
of seats number of let me call me

968
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:36,900
requested okay I called the eggs egg on
its return me reservation is I think a
yeah

969
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:43,710
so has a ration but since it's an ascent
method I will have to await that and

970
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:49,500
truth sorry some like that stood up to
obtain and a second score but since your

971
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:54,840
method is I think because it's called
also a sink method I asked you to do so

972
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:01,020
and then adapt from a hot to this is a
method blood already done we had adapter

973
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:05,300
adapter damage sure I provide a
reservation and I get some string and

974
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:12,090
yeah I have to return you see I get a
resolution from the business logic and

975
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:22,230
then what I do is to add up back from
the domain to the design procedure this
is still read what did I miss

976
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:29,689
[Music]

977
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:44,650
you have to wait wait wait also because
of a weight this is Mexican Russian okay
it's room sorry it was a second way to

978
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:52,780
issue that's time to implement in SSP
net so here as you can see within one
acceptance test we have done what we

979
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:59,530
have to do is in composition note of the
application I don't know what you want

980
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:08,650
to do well we have less than 10 minutes
I think what that part should be the one

981
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:13,000
that we will put into the setup of the
application so I can do that plug into

982
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,370
the webosphere but maybe it's better to
keep some time for questions or for kind

983
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,969
of wrap up what do you think okay
yeah otherwise I think I will have to

984
01:55:21,969 --> 01:55:35,320
run because we kind of little bit late
yeah so wrap up we started from

985
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:42,130
situation like this we have a web ticket
manager with a very procedural code do

986
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:48,450
this and then do that and then do this
and and and after we lead to some more

987
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:56,370
consistent and more I don't know what to
say not shot yeah God walking code also

988
01:55:56,370 --> 01:56:02,800
after the method was kind of something
like this thing is yes pretty much what

989
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:09,489
we achieved what's important is that we
embrace the language of our domain
within our code plus legacy code very

990
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:17,469
crappy and when we if we had time to
executor and append

991
01:56:17,469 --> 01:56:25,050
we will have less warnings we just you
know in second just just in front yeah

992
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:30,160
so we are we walk code now it's talking
about reservations but trains reception

993
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:35,710
at term present which is fulfilled you
see so much even if all the way expect

994
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:42,469
is not able to read our code we can read
occurred in front of him and

995
01:56:42,469 --> 01:56:49,070
being yeah being able to have a
discussion and he's being able to say no

996
01:56:49,070 --> 01:56:54,340
no this is not what I want for for that
system star star so there is less

997
01:56:54,340 --> 01:57:00,199
friction there is less gaps between what
we implemented what we was talking about
so it's better if you want to follow him

998
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:11,810
yeah we had some independent show it in
a few seconds but just before that no no

999
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:19,310
yeah that's because it takes time to
switch as a final wrap-up we did not

1000
01:57:19,310 --> 01:57:23,810
have to time to to make you feel that
because automate expertise in Paris and

1001
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:29,120
our first version was with him on stage
but it's crucial to talk to your domain
experts yeah most of the project has

1002
01:57:31,429 --> 01:57:36,710
issue because the river are not even
allowed to able to talk to Dominic spats

1003
01:57:36,710 --> 01:57:41,239
so for me so no it's a no-go I finish I
decide not to go to the project if it's
like this but it wasn't the case at the

1004
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:50,300
beginning of my career so takes yes it
takes courage time determination to

1005
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:58,120
enforce that but it's crucial otherwise
yeah not as if they don't buy the legacy

1006
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:04,610
because I'm a coach and I learn how to
refactor the code generate people when

1007
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:09,560
there is dependencies said my code is
not testable actually we can test any

1008
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:16,820
code any code so don't be daunted by it
I guess you may have some cost yeah it
cost I but it's doable yeah and also do

1009
01:58:21,530 --> 01:58:27,080
it's we don't use a lot of techniques
here we basically use two basic

1010
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:30,260
techniques from the refactoring book of
nothing further

1011
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:35,780
it's extract and move methods so it's
pretty much simple as soon as you have a
test Alice which is the first steps you

1012
01:58:38,199 --> 01:58:44,739
can extract and move very very easily
the more complicated is to find some

1013
01:58:44,739 --> 01:58:53,640
proper semantics and to and to invest in
your domain design they we have great

1014
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:57,930
in track of improvement as you just said
by some of you yes this is something

1015
01:58:57,930 --> 01:59:05,730
that is a living and ensuring you have
yeah you have been very interactive user
so thank you very much

1016
01:59:07,190 --> 01:59:12,340
