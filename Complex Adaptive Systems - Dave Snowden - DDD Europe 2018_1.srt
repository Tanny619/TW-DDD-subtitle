1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Thank you
<a>谢谢</a>

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,000
I think my job today is to introduce to new ways of thinking the new concepts so I thought I'd start you off with the picture right.<a>我今天的主题就是向大家介绍一种对新理念的新的思考方式，我将从一张图片开始介绍</a>

3
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,224
This is from... and I'm hoping this will work<a>这张图片拍摄于... 希望这个图片能够显示出来</a>

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,500
This mounting here is called xxxxtripping????<a>这座山叫xxx</a>

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
About two or three people died on it every year<a>每年都会了两到三人遇险</a>

6
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,256
Partly because they don't take it seriously, it's only just 3000 feet. yeah<a>部分是因为这座山只有3000英尺高，没有引起游客重视</a>

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,912
But that's a territory I'm going to come back and reference that in a minute but that's kind like where I grew up that's what I feel at home<a>但这是我还想再去的地方，这里给了我家的感觉，就好像我在这长大似的。</a>

8
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,216
now which is another concept that I'm going to come to<a>接下来会有另外一个理念</a>

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,616
Now what I want to do today is to introduce some new ways of thinking some new ideas to move things forward<a>今天的主题就是向大家介绍一种将事情向前推进的新的思考方式。</a>

10
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
I want to start off by some thoughts on language<a>我想从我在语言上的想法开始</a>

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,320
You may or may not have grown up with Winnie the Pooh if you're British you did<a>如果你在英国长大，你可能或者不是看着小熊维尼长大。</a>

12
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,904
And you find the Disney version quite a appalling right<a>然后你发现迪士尼版本令人震惊</a>

13
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:07,584
But there's a whole sort of structural trope which goes on on the web of people using Winnie the Pooh pictures with favorite sayings<a>对那些喜欢用小熊维尼作为网页头像的人来说，存在某些比喻</a>

14
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,960
And you look at both of these, right you have to be a Star Trek fan to understand the second<a>你已经看过这两张图片了，对吧？只有星际迷航的粉丝才能理解第二幅图片</a>

15
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,568
The reference to the episode of Monk and the use of metaphor

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
We use very complex metaphors to explain various complex ideas in Simple Words<a>我们用仅几个词但非常复杂的隐喻去解释复杂的意思</a>

17
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,064
Also language change is very very quickly if you look at the left-hand one<a>同时如果你看左边这张图，你会发现语言发展非常非常之快</a>

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
It's almost getting out of date now because the level of stupidity is gone even before above that alright or below that<a>这几乎都已经要过时了，因为现在糊涂程度正在发生变化</a>

19
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
But the actual context of that and the subtlety of all the messages and all the stories that lie behind it<a>隐藏在后面的微妙的上下文信息及所有的故事</a>

20
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
Goes way beyond traditional methods of codification<a>发展的方向都与传统的编写手法相去甚远</a>

21
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,592
So I can start think about language a bit and this goes back to a quote from the philosopher Martin heidegger<a>因而我能够从语言开始，并回到哲学家 马丁 海德格尔的一句名言</a>

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm sorry about this but when he was writing I should I can't change his language to say woman and man or whatever but he basically said <a>很抱歉用语中男人和女人的区分，但是当他写下这句话时我没法改变他的用语</a>

23
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368
Man thinks he's a master of language but actually language is the master of Man<a>人类以为自己掌控着语言，但事实是语言掌控着人类</a>

24
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
And the important thing to realise is the language you speak<a>重要的是你所说的语言</a>

25
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Largely determines how you see the world<a>扩展了你所认识的世界</a>

26
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
Yeah I'm getting the language right is there for key<a>这正是我学习正确语言的关键</a>

27
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,192
And it isn't just the fact that my first degree in physics and philosophy joint honours<a>不仅仅是我的物理学和哲学学士学位联合荣誉这一事实</a>

28
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,312
Which give me a Desire for simplicity and purpose in beauty and lots of the stuff<a>它让我学会渴望简单，追求美好及很多</a>

29
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
And language is actually quite important<a>语言在其中发挥的作用非常重要</a>

30
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,296
Now in order to fully understand this what I want to do is come back to this particular picture<a>为了弄明白我所说的，让我们看一下这张图片</a>

31
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Yeah and start to think about a couple of things<a>并且想象一些事情</a>

32
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,744
First of all I want to make a distinction between sense-making with a hyphen <a>首先我想区分一下意识构建和</a>

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
And sensemaking as one word in the original <a>和构建意识</a>

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,448
For those of you are familiar with calverts working if you haven't read that I recommend it <a>对那些熟悉卡尔弗特工作的人，如果你还没有读过那我推荐你读一下</a>

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
He talks about sensemaking <a>他谈到了构建意识</a>

36
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,592
But it comes from an academic tradition where you study cases<a>但在学习时他采用的的是学术解释</a>

37
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,456
I'm from cases you derive Theory you should all be better to be fully familiar with that<a>你通过案例得出理论你应该更好地完全熟悉它</a>

38
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
It's an empirical approach<a>这是一种经验方法</a>

39
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,368
Sensemaking which is myself climbing others comes from a different perspective<a></a>

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
It says what do we know from natural science<a>它介绍的是我们所知道的自然科学的知识</a>

41
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,024
And how do we apply natural science to human systems<a>以及我们如何将自然科学应用到人类系统</a>

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
And use that to create a different level of certainty<a>并且以此来找到它的确定性</a>

43
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,216
The reason we do that is natural science can replicate his experiments<a>我们这么做是因为自然科学可以进行经验复用</a>

44
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Social science can't<a>社会科学却不行</a>

45
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,128
And I'll come back and validate that in a minute just come make a background of the key distinction

46
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
The next key distinction I make which is not used to efficiently<a>我识别出的下一个关键区别是不习惯有效</a>

47
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
It's between typologies and taxonomies<a>介于类型学与分类学</a>

48
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,672
Data taxonomy people are familiar with we liked put things into categories<a>数据分类人员熟悉我们喜欢将事物分类</a>

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
The problem is that in English taxonomy rhymes with taxidermy<a>问题在于英语中分类学与动物标本押韵</a>

50
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,120
And produces very similar results<a>从而产生非常相似的结果</a>

51
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,984
Over rigid structures in which the boundary conditions become very dangerous<a>在刚性结构中越界是非常危险的事情</a>

52
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,824
Because you make things fit into space even if they don't<a>因为这样你会把原本不能放进去的物体放进这个空间里面去</a>

53
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,248
I'm a typology on the other hand is a way of looking at things from different perspectives<a>一个类型学家会从另外一个不同的角度来看待</a>

54
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,088
Now I'm going to be mainly today talking about typologies<a>我今天主要谈论类型学家</a>

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,440
Looking at things from different perspectives to actually make sense of the world<a>从另外一个不同的角度看待事物，从而让世界符合认知</a>

56
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
rather than try and create rigid classifications<a>而不是尝试创建一个死板的分类</a>

57
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
And then we get into the stuff we were talking about in the bar last night<a>然后接下来会开始谈论昨天在酒吧讨论的</a>

58
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,447
Which is the whole issue of map Models and frameworks<a>关于整个地图模型和框架所存在的问题</a>

59
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,287
And he's often get conflated or confused<a>他经常变得混乱或困惑</a>

60
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
So I'll give you my basic distinctions at the moment yeah<a>我接下来给大家介绍基本的区别</a>

61
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
A model seeks to represent the world<用模型表达世界>

62
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,295
I'm going to come back later from a complexity perspective<我稍后会回来从复杂性角度介绍>

63
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,183
And quote Murray gell-mann The only valid model of a human system is the system itself<引用默里格尔曼的观点，唯一能够验证人类系统的模型就是人类系统本身>

64
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Now that starts to give us problems<现在给我们带来了一些麻烦>

65
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,399
A model seeks to represent the world and we see this a lot in systems architecture in elsewhere<一个想要表达全世界的模型，我们在很多系统架构中都看到了>

66
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
And then people work within the model framework<人们借助模型进行工作>

67
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
But the trouble is there are limits to the application of models<但问题是应用模型是有局限的>

68
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
It doesn't mean they're not useful but we need to be careful<这并不是说模型没有用，而是应该小心使用>

69
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
A framework on the other hand is generally a typology<换句话说框架是一门类型学>

70
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,551
It's a way of looking at things from different perspectives so you can make distinctions<这是一种从不同角度看事物的方式，因此你可以做出区分>

71
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
And therefore by those making distinctions do things in different ways<因此，做出区分后就会以不同的方式做事>

72
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,023
And then a map gives you somewhere placing yourself of understanding where you are <一份图示可以帮助你认识自己理解到了什么程度>

73
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:30,239
So this is the actual map of the area that you show the picture of earlier, this is the Nun frakkin egwin Valley this ribbon<所以这是你所展示的早期图片的实际地图>

74
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:35,103
You can see a bit, now that's a 1:25000 scale map< 你能看到一些，这是张地图是1:25000>

75
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,455
It's a really good planning map you're not going to make any major mistakes on that<这是一个非常好的规划图，你不会在那里犯任何重大错误>

76
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
That you can see the tracks you can see the contour lines<你可以看到轨迹和轮廓线>

77
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,183
Now most of us if we're walking there use Harvey maps Which work on  1:40000 scale<现在我们走去那里都会使用Harvey地图，这些地图的工作范围比例尺是1：40000>

78
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,071
If you actually look at that that's been designed very specifically for walkers<如果你仔细的看那个专为步行者设计的地图>

79
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,703
It's got much more detail on it you can actually see where there a cliff somewhere there aren't<你能从中获得更多的信息，包括悬崖在哪>

80
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,079
The golden rule if you have a walk on the way， if you get lost， stay to the crest<在你迷路的情况下，黄金法则就是朝着波峰走去>

81
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
It may be scary but you won't die<这可能很可怕，但你不会死>

82
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,527
If you try and take a short cut you'll die right in terms of cliff<在悬崖边如果你试着走捷径，你就会死>

83
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,927
And of course no matter how familiar you are with Maps you can make mistakes the danger with Maps as you become overconfident<当然无论你对地图多么熟悉，如果过于自信都会犯危险的错误>

84
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,839
We don't read them again we see forward If I go back to roughly this time. last year I made exactly that mistake on the top of tripping<如果我再回那我会向前看不再仔细看地图。去年我在绊倒之前犯了这个错误>

85
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
with that net result in 8 stitches yeah<产生的后果就是缝了8针>

86
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:37,823
So Maps don't design that should never taken a selfie. the family never forgave me for that<所以地图不会设计说不应该自拍，家庭从来没有原谅我>

87
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
I said I realised it was bad I fell over on the top and I walked down the field I'll just take a picture before I wash my head<我说我意识到这很糟糕。 我在上面跌倒，然后走下了田野。 在我洗头之前，拍了一张照片>

88
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Go and give a lecture at the university<去大学做演讲>

89
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,367
And took the picture and realise oh my god I'm gonna have to go to hospital<我拍下照片，并意识到我将不得不去医院>

90
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
And then the perfect tweet came to mind. Red door on tripping so that kept me going to the bottom because I really wanted<然后想到了完美的推文。 旅途上有个红色的门通往山底>

91
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
The tweet with the picture<推文可以配张图>

92
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
And shall we say cause some problems<我们应该说会引起一些问题>

93
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:08,543
The point is that Maps give you a starting point but you still got to be careful and familiarity breeds contempt<地图给你一个起点，但你仍然要小心, 对熟悉的内容反而会引起蔑视轻视>

94
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
I'm trying to create some basic language at the moment<我正在尝试创建一些基本语言>

95
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,015
The other points and this is one of the biggest issues I see with architecture and elsewhere this is from an Mount Pendleton<另外一点这是我在架构中看到的最大问题之一，而在其他地方，这是来自彭德尔顿山xxxx>

96
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,159
Julian a good friend of mine and she's currently actually just about to publish a new book with John Seely Brown on design<我的一位好朋友Julian目前正准备与John Seely Brown合作出版一本关于设计的新书>

97
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,023
Working with us on an complexity approach to design thinking with Stanford University<与Stanford大学合作的关于进行设计思维的复杂方法>

98
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
I may come back to that a bit later<我稍后可能会再回过头来>

99
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
She says and this is a critical point the whole point about scaffolding is you take it away when you've completed the building<她说到一个关键点脚手架的重点在于构建完后可以去掉它
>

100
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,847
Get the scaffolding isn't the endpoint it's a means to an end<搭建脚手架不是终点只是达到目的的手段>

101
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,455
one of things I see far too much within the whole of the IT industry<在整个IT行业中我看到了太多这样的事情>

102
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Is a focus on scaffolding as the end<把脚手架作为结果>

103
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
In fact often it's the way the truth and the life<事实上这往往是真理和生活方式>

104
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
Yet methods are elevated to the level of religion<然而方法被提升到宗教>

105
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Yeah I need a allergy in terms of the way it works<我需要对它的工作方式保持敏感>

106
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
Has somebody's just launched a new approach to business agility<有人提出了业务敏捷方法>

107
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
And guess what the approach is a two-day course with a certificate at the end of it<猜猜怎样，两天的课程后会颁发一个证书>

108
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,519
That's a level of trivialization we're now getting to<这是我们现在要达到的平凡程度>

109
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,359
So understanding that is key the other thing to <因此理解这个的另一个关键是>

110
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
realize is that there are no recipes<认识到这没有指南>

111
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
I'm going to justify this more as I come onto complexity<遇到复杂性时我会更好地证明这一点>

112
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
And I want to make a key distinction between a recipe book user and a chef<我想在按照食谱做饭的人和厨师之间做出重要区分>

113
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
A recipe book user follow the recipe<人们按照食谱制作>

114
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,351
If I have all the right equipment and all the right ingredients there's no problem it works<如果我拥有所有合适的设备和所有正确的配料，那么它就没有问题>

115
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
But if anything goes wrong<但如果出现任何偏差>

116
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
They haven't got the ability the resilience to adjust<他们没有能力调整调整>

117
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,151
A chef on the other hand can make a brilliant meal with whatever they have to hand<另一方面，厨师可以随心所欲地做出精彩的一餐>

118
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,039
And the reason is they have two types of knowledge would Aristotle called phronesis and Sophia<原因是他们有两种类型的知识，亚里士多德称为精明和智慧>

119
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
They have the theoretical knowledge of taste<他们有理论知识倾向>

120
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
And the practical knowledge about apprenticeship<学徒式的实践知识>

121
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,047
And it's the combination of 4 or 5 years of apprenticeship<这是4年或5年学徒期的结合>

122
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,887
With deep Theoretical knowledge about the nature of food<对食物的本质有深刻的理论知识>

123
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,983
It's the combination which gives them resilient it's not one or the other<厨师组合使它们具有特性，既不是这一个或也不是另一个>

124
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,103
And at the moment we turn people to argue for theory or practice or practice of a theory<目前我们转向争论理论本身是实践或理论实践>

125
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
And that's a mistake we need to build more chefs and fewer recipe book uses<这是一个错误，我们需要培养更多的厨师和更少的食谱书使用>

126
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:29,343
So I want to do is to go through three basic bits of Science and then start to apply them<所以我想要介绍三个基本的科学，然后开始应用它们>

127
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
First is the reality of the way that human beings perceive things<首先是人类感知事物的真实的方式>

128
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,815
A second thing is how do we create novelty this is going to be really important<第二个很重要的是我们如何创造新奇>

129
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,911
Because we try and remove accidents in system design<因为我们尝试消除系统设计中的事故>

130
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,519
When actually in the history of evolution accidents of the most important thing<事实上事故在演进过程中扮演最重要的事故角色>

131
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
It's called serendipity if you want the English language word for it<如果用英语词语表达那就是‘意外发现’>

132
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
I'll go through that again finally<我们最后再过一遍>

133
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:00,063
We can't predict your model and that's what I introduce complexity theory and runs for the Keynesian framework<我们无法预测您的模型，这就是我为凯恩斯主义框架引入复杂性理论和运行的内容>

134
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
For the first in terms of perception<首先是感知方面>

135
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
And this experiment which is been repeated many times<这个实验已多次重复>

136
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:13,887
If anybody comes to you and says I've done for a pi projects let me tell you from my experience this is what you should do<如果有人来找你并说我做了四到五个项目让我告诉你通过我的经验这该怎么做>

137
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
They really don't understand the Core Science<他们真的不了解核心科学>

138
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,103
If they do three projects which partly succeed and create a worldwide method and accreditation scheme on it<如果他们做了三个部分成功的项目，并基于此上创建了一个全球性知名的方法和认证计划>

139
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
And that's called snake oil salesman and charlatan<这就是所谓的蛇油推销员和骗子>

140
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
And there's a lot of them around at the moment<目前他们周围有很多人>

141
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:36,415
Fundamentally if you give a batch of radiologists， Now remember radiologists are coming off of 4 to 5 generation body of knowledge<从根本上说，如果你选出一批放射科医生，放射科医师正掌握着第4或5代身体知识>

142
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,791
This is important to realise architecture it's probably a 3 generation body of knowledge<很重要的是要理解架构可能是3代知识体系>

143
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,887
Doctors are a 5000 generation body of knowledge<医生掌握第5000代知识体系>

144
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:52,543
As more generations build knowledge, practice gets built into the processes the training<随着更多代人建立知识，实践被纳入培训过程>

145
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
You got more reliabilit<你能得到更高的可靠性>

146
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
That's a radiologist have a full five generation body of knowledge<拥有完整的五代知识体系的放射性医生>

147
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
are dealing with the limited information set<正在处理有限的信息集>

148
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,343
Yeah in a controlled environment and most of them I got 10 or 15 years training<大多数人在受控制的环境中接受了10年或15年的培训>

149
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
If you give them a batch of X-rays and ask them to look for anomalies<如果你让他们查看一批X射线并要求他们寻找异常
>

150
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
On  one of the x-rays you hide a picture of a gorilla which is 48 times the size of an average cancer nodule <在其中一张X光后隐藏一只大猩猩的照片，它是普通癌症结节的48倍>

151
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
83% don't see it<83%的放射科医生没有看见它>

152
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
Even though the right physically scanner<即使是正确的物理扫描仪>

153
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,591
We do not see What we do not intend to see<我们看不见我们不想看的内容>

154
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
We actually only see what we expect to see<我们事实只看见我们期望看见的>

155
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,087
And the scary thing is the 17% to do see it  come to believe they were wrong<可怕的是17％的看到的人以为自己错了>

156
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
When they talk with the others<当他们与其他人交谈时>

157
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,071
Alright now that one slide undermines any approach<现在一张幻灯片打破了>

158
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,935
Based on anybody observing what other People do<基于任何观察其他人行为的方法>

159
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,567
Because if you're an academic or a consultant to you going steady companies<因为如果你是一名学者或顾问，你会去稳定的公司>

160
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,151
You only see what you expect to see<你只能看到你期望看到的东西>

161
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
That's just life<这只是生活>

162
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,295
It's called confirmation bias in attentional bias in Inception<它在Inception中被称为注意力偏见中的确认偏差>

163
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,391
Such Simon is being berating management textbooks most of this week<本周西蒙一直在抨击管理教科书>

164
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:17,535
I'm quite pleased about this I normally the nasty going the internet is now becoming even nastier so that's good news<我对此感到非常高兴, 我讨厌互联网现在变得更加肮脏，所以这是个好消息>

165
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:26,495
Except I think he's been generous.  I haven't yet seen a single popular management textbook Which actually didn't Commit This fundamental error<除了我认为他大度. 我还没有看到一个流行的管理教科书犯这个样的基本错误>

166
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
Yeah they go and observe things, the interview people<他们观察事物，采访人物>

167
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
They believe what people say when they're interviewed inform that they construct method<他们相信人们在接受采访时所说的话会能够帮助他们形成方法论>

168
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,527
The good news on this is there's a huge amount there at to be discovered<这样做的好消息是有大量的东西需要发现>

169
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
If we architect systems in the right way<如果我们以正确的方式架构系统>

170
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,671
But we won't know What we need until we discover it<但是在发现之前我们不会知道我们需要什么>

171
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,791
It is the the second thing key aspects from evolutionary biology<这是生物进化学的第二个关键方面\>

172
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
This is called exaptation<这被称为exaptation>

173
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
I know we had a general problem with creationist will we still have a problem in the states which is growing right<我知道我们与创造论者有一个普遍的问题，我们仍然会在正在成长的国家遇到问题
>

174
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:07,967
We thought we'd eliminated that's everything and I think is now 52% of people in the United States believe the world was created in the last 6000 years<我们认为我们已经消除了这一切，现在52％的美国人认为这个世界是在过去的6000年里创造的>

175
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Which is really scary<这真的很可怕>

176
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,087
I'm doing work with Ebola management teams in Dallas<我正在与在达拉斯的埃博拉管理团队合作>

177
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,463
And I was told I couldn't talk about evolution because it's a controversial Theory<我被告知我不能谈论关于进化，因为它是一个有争议的理论>

178
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,815
And that's it your Ebola management teams, all right this gets really scary<这就是你的埃博拉管理团队，这真非常可怕>

179
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,215
Yeah but we did have a general problem with it because there isn't enough time in the evolutionary timescale<但我们确实遇到了一个普遍的问题，因为在进化时间表上没有足够的时间>

180
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
The human intelligence to have evolved<人类智慧已经发展>

181
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
On a linear basis it just won't work<线性思维已经行不通>

182
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
The other side of crude Neo-darwinian night near darwinian ISM

183
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
A people like Richard Dawkins in the light<>

184
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,855
with its linear approach it's causal approach actually just doesn't work we got a problem<利用线性思维形成的方法无法工作，会遇到问题>

185
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,743
Then with Robin Hood linksmi Gorgon others we discovered a thing called acceptation

186
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
two illustration of that

187
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,143
Dinosaurs feathers evolved for warmth we can see it in the fossil record<恐龙的羽毛是为了温暖而进化而来的，我们可以在化石记录中看到它>

188
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
It's over a long period of time<这会经历很长一段时间>

189
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,031
Yeah it's kind of like Dinosaurs with no feathers or warmer<温血的恐龙没有羽毛>

190
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,383
Therefore they survive more to breed that's a classic adaptation linear process<因此，他们繁殖生存符合经典的适应线性过程>

191
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,527
And then by luck and it turns out the actual evolution isn't survival of the fittest. it's survivor the luckiest<然后事实证明，实际的进化并不是适者生存，幸存者是最幸运的>

192
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Something into that in Darwin's notebooks but he says this is too going too far so decide not to say it<在达尔文的笔记本中有些东西他认为这不好解释，所以决定不去说
>

193
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Is that to be true<这是真的吗?>

194
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,863
there's an arboreal species of dinosaurs because it's cold at the top of tree so you get more feathers<对于树顶的恐龙物种，因为树顶很冷所会长出更多的羽毛
>

195
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
But you also fall from trees<但你还是从树上掉下来了>

196
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,079
Which means you learn to fly Actually flight is a nonlinear<这意味着你学飞行实际上是非线性的>

197
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Acceptation

198
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
A trait which evolved for one function and the stress<为一种特长和面对压力而演变的特质>

199
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
Exit through different functions<退化不同的能力>

200
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
I couldn't handle anyway because if dinosaurs threw themselves off trees in the hope of evolving feathers before they hit the ground<我无论如何无法处理，恐龙将自己扔在下树，并希望在落地之前进化出羽毛>

201
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,559
The timescale for breeding is very short and the consequences are quite dangerous<繁殖的时间表非常短，后果非常危险>

202
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,350
of course once you've got acceptation you get adaptation<当然，一旦你接受了，你就会适应>

203
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,727
I was tracked by the bikes not so many months ago<不久的几个月前我自行车被跟踪了>

204
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
By a tawny owl who actually literally followed me from mild and a bit of queues it was fascinating experience at dusk<排队时被一只黄褐色的猫头鹰温和的跟踪，这是黄昏时的迷人体验>

205
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,455
And you can't hear an owl fly<你听不到猫头鹰的飞翔声>

206
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:21,343
Because of feathers have involved silence that's just literally can't hear them absolutely silent flight<因为羽毛的轻柔所以绝对不会听到它们>

207
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,927
So after accepting you get adaptation<所以在接受后你会适应>

208
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
But the adaptation is based on where it started<但适应是基于它从哪里开始>

209
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,655
There's any design in this the starting point determines the path way forwards<在这方面有任何设计，起点决定了前进的道路>

210
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
You should stop at the scene where I'm going with some of the stuff now<你现在应该停下来我现在要去的地方>

211
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,895
At the other one I love it's a cerebellum at the base of your brain evolved to manipulate muscles in fingers<另一个我喜欢的是，你大脑底部的小脑进化到能操纵手指的肌肉>

212
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,247
It accepts in humans to manage the control of grammar in language<它支持人类在语言中进行语法控制>

213
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
So huge sophistication of human language<人类语言的巨大复杂性>

214
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,183
was a radical repurposing not a linear adaptation<是一种激进的再利用，而非线性适应>

215
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
If you don't think that's relevant<如果你认为这是不相关的>

216
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,351
Then look at what connects the magneto of a radar machine<然后看看雷达的磁发电机，>

217
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
A Hershey bar and a microwave oven<好时巧克力棒与微波炉的联系>

218
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
In 1945 a racing engineer<1945年一名赛车工程师>

219
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,407
Maintaining the Magneto of a ride-on machine noticed that a chocolate bar melted in the pocket<维护磁发电机注意到巧克力棒在口袋中融化>

220
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
Now 99 out of 100 engineers you notice this would swear and have their trousers cleaned<你会发现99%的工程师会发誓要清理裤子>

221
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,671
This guy realises significance<这家伙意识到了重要性>

222
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
And we got microwave ovens<于是我们有微波炉>

223
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
If you look at the history of technology<如果你看一下技术史>

224
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,143
It's a history of exaptive moments a radical repurposing<这是一个充满活力的历史，是一个不断的重新定位>

225
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
Some of the stuff I'll talk about in the strategy session with Simon later on this afternoon<我将在今天下午晚些时候与西蒙一起的战略会议中一些内容
>

226
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:51,199
Is if you look at it you get first mover advantage by repurposing existing technology for novel purpose<讨论的是如果你能看到新颖的目的，你可以通过重新利用现有技术获得先发优势>

227
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
IBM does it with punch cards<IBM通过打孔计算机做到了>

228
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,111
Microsoft does it with software developer for IBM<微软通过为IBM进行软件开发做到了>

229
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
An apple does it with next after next went bankrupt<苹果公司通过一次又一次的破产做到了>

230
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
Get the radical evolution of a new apex predator<激进演变成新的顶尖捕食者>

231
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,143
Is generally based on radical repurposing of an existing technology<通常基于对现有技术的彻底重新利用>

232
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Under conditions of stress<在存在压力的情况下>

233
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,055
Who won the big things when they're starting to work on in terms of Architecture and design<会获得巨大收益当他们开始从事架构和设计工作>

234
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Is how do you design for serendipity<你是如何设计偶然性的>

235
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
Serendipity is a wonderful English word it comes from Earth<意外发现是地球的上最精彩的英语单词>

236
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
Ancient I think Italian story retold by Walpole

237
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,415
About the Two Princes Of serendipity Who get sent on quests<关于两个被派遣秘密任务的王子的意外发现>

238
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
And they never found what they were looking for<他们从未找到他们想要的东西>

239
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
But they find more useful things instead<但他们发现更多有用的东西>

240
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
That and that's called serendipity<这就是所谓的意外发现>

241
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
And reality is human invention human inside human understanding<现实是人类在人类理解中发明的人类>

242
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,335
Is generally accepted not additive<这基本被接受而不是附加的>

243
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,711
But that architectural structures tend to be drawn from engineering diagrams<但建筑结构往往来自工程图>

244
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Not from ecosystem<而不是生态系统>

245
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
That's the big thing I'm going to start to argue for<这是我要开始争辩的重要事情>

246
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,903
Need to start to think about human systems is a complex psychology<需要开始思考人类系统是一种复杂的心理学>

247
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
Not a something which can be reduced to an engineering diagram<不是可以简化为工程图的东西>

248
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Because that reduces much of the richness<因为这减少了很多丰富性>

249
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
It's leads me onto complexity<它引出了复杂性>

250
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
I need a some of the most misused words that we know about<我需要一些我们所知道的最误用的词>

251
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,151
Complexity is a knotty problem and people use complex and complicated in the same way<复杂性是一个棘手的问题，人们把繁杂和复杂等同>

252
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,247
And people make statements like they want to reduce complexity<人们会说希望降低复杂性>

253
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
And I'm sorry about this for future speaker but complexity doesn't fail

254
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,159
The nature of a complex system is it always fails<复杂系统的本质是它始终失败>

255
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Now again<再重复一遍>

256
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,559
The failure is actually quite important and I'll come back and describe that<失败实际上非常重要，我会再回来描述介绍一下>

257
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,423
When you architect the complex system you design it for early failure<当你架构一个复杂系统时，你应该设计早期失败>

258
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,519
Big is only through of your failure could you discover what's possible anyway<只有通过你的失败，你才能发现什么是可能的>

259
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,871
So let me go through and build on this now build a canary in French<让我现在用法语建立一个金丝雀xxxx>

260
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,015
So basically we have three types of system in nature, ordered systems, complex systems and chaotic systems<所以基本上我们有三种类型的系统, 有序系统, 复杂系统和混沌系统>

261
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,599
I'm going to define these in terms of constraints<我将根据约束来定义这些>

262
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
An ordered system is highly constrained<有序系统受到严格限制>

263
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:16,351
There's very little degree of freedom is very little ability for anything to do anything outside The rules<几乎没有什么自由度，几乎没有事情在规则之外>

264
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,703
That you don't see these in nature by the way then work more less unique to human beings<你没有在自然界中看到这些，但对人类来说没那么独特>

265
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
An example I often give is an operating theatre<我经常举手术室的例子>

266
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:30,687
In an operating theatre we now count the number of surgical instruments left at the end of an operation<在手术室中，我们计算在手术结束时留下的手术器械的数量>

267
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,503
And jackets the same as were there at the start<以及外套的数量，必须跟手术前相同>

268
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,623
Yeah as I get older I think this sort of stuff is of increasing importance<随着年龄的增长，我认为这种东西越来越重要
>

269
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,767
Yeah I know how many people had to have a second operation because surgical instruments will left in the body<我知道不少人必须进行第二次手术，是因为手术器械遗留在体内>

270
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,143
That is actually over 10% on average across the world before the checklist were introduced<在核对清单出台之前，全世界的平均超过了10％>

271
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,287
If you ever been into an operating theatre it's pretty goddamn messy it's easy to lose things alright<如果你曾经去过一个手术室，那真的很混乱，很容易遗忘东西>

272
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
And the trouble is that losing things inside somebody's body<麻烦的是把东西遗忘在了人体内>

273
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
Has major consequences yes the order is good<有重大影响的场景下，有序是好的>

274
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
But the cost of that is high<但是成本很高>

275
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,879
When a doctor or a nurse goes into an operating theatre anybody been into an operating theatre vertically<所有医生或护士进入手术室时都会垂直是直立的进入手术室>

276
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,047
I've been in once horizontally in twice vertically alright and I almost got divorced I need to the vertical locations<我有一次躺着，两次直立进手术室。我差点离婚。我需要站着。>

277
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,471
occasions my two children were both to quote William Shakespeare from their mother's womb untimely ripped<莎士比亚说我他的两个孩子从母亲肚子出生时都是历经磨难>

278
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
Said it was Cesarean section<也就是剖腹产>

279
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,407
The trouble is I grew up in a veterinary household with animals being detected on the kitchen table over breakfast<问题是我在一个兽医家庭长大，早餐时在厨房的桌子上发现了动物>

280
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,039
So from my point for your Cesarean section was a really interesting operation and can I look more closely<从我的角度看待的这个剖腹产手术会是一个非常有趣的手术，我可以更仔细地观察>

281
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,391
And I forgot that was meant to be there for the purposes<我会忘了那是为了这个目的而存在的>

282
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,047
But either way if you go to into the operating theatre you go through some elaborate ritual of washing up<但无论哪种方式，如果你去进手术室要经历精细的清洗步骤>

283
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,215
What that does Is？ it's a ritual cognitive activation is what ritual does for humans<这是什么？这是一种认知激活对人类的作用
>

284
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,335
It aligns the individual To the role that they are occupied<它使个体与他们的角色保持一致>

285
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
The reason you don't see what you don't expect to see is at best your scanning 3% of what's in front of you<您没有看到您不希望看到的内容的原因充其量是您扫描前面3％的内容>

286
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
And matching it against dominant patterns based on recent experience<并根据最近的经验将其与自己主导的模式相匹配>

287
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,696
What ritual does is to change their patterns<什么仪式改变他们的模式?>

288
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
So you see the world differently<所以你对世界的看法不同>

289
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
We are playing with experiments with software testers<我们正在和软件测试人员做实验>

290
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,912
I'm getting them to change clothes before they test their code<我让他们在测试代码之前换衣服>

291
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
Because you actually want me to have a different cognitive activation pattern<你实际上希望我拥有不同的认知激活模式>

292
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
From me I develop this it's going to work<我这样激活认知并取得了效果>

293
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
Into the sort of testing and support type environments<这样的方式对这些测试有效且多种环境下依然有效>

294
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Ritual is used extensively in military environments <仪式在军事环境中广泛使用>

295
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
So that's good Valuable<所以这很有价值>

296
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,832
The trouble is we then take it to excess<麻烦的是我们接下来过度了>

297
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
I work for IBM for 7 years<我在IBM工作了7年>

298
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,488
I hasten to add I was conscripted I didn't volunteer<我补充一下，我是被征募者非志愿者>

299
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,656
It worked out quite well for me I'm still proud of the fact I didn't fill out a timesheet in 7 years that's a World record breath<我在那工作不错。我仍然为我在7年内没有填写时间工时表感到骄傲，这是一个世界纪录的呼吸>

300
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,544
It takes a level of defiance which are here even I didn't think I was capable but I managed it<需要一定程度的蔑视它，即使我不认为我有能力，但我可以管理它>

301
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
And I managed to avoid the school cross country run for 9 years so I think you know that was a slightly better achievement alright<我设法避免学校越野跑了9年. 这是一个稍微大一点的成就>

302
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,368
Either way that took me more about bureaucracy than anything else I can remember<无论哪种方式都比我记忆中的其它事情让我更多地了解官僚主义>

303
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,280
They take us over we were in Anglo Dutch company called data Sciences we had a flat management hierarchy<他们把我们带到了我们在Anglo荷兰公司，称为数据科学，我们是扁平化的组织结构>

304
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
Everybody knew everybody else kind of like we got things done and<每个人都认识其他人, 就像我们所有事情都完成了>

305
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,656
And then we became part of the world's largest Bureaucracy<然后我们成为世界上最大的官僚机构的一部分>

306
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,752
And the first thing they did was to charges for coffee and buying alcohol<他们做的第一件事就是咖啡收费和然后买酒>

307
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:40,384
Now this is completely unreasonable the alcohol coffee cycle<现在完全处于这样的一个循环中了>

308
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
it is critical for good software development<它对于良好的软件开发至关重要>

309
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,904
Nobody should be expected to talk to users without alcohol first<没有人在没有酒精的时候和用户交谈>

310
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:57,024
You don't have to sober up to write the code and then you need even more alcohol<你不必清醒地编写代码，然后你需要更多的酒精>

311
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,608
Because users never want what you can prove they asked for<因为用户永远不会想要证明他们所提要求>

312
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,984
When you give them the what they asked what they discover they wanted something else instead<当你告诉他们他们所提要求，发现他们想要别的东西替代>

313
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,128
I'm going to come back to that later because also architecture is about dealing with an articulated needs<我稍后会再回过头来看，因为架构就是处理明确需求>

314
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Not articulated needs

315
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,784
That technology capability is progressing faster<技术能力正在加快发展>

316
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
Than user know what to ask for<比用户知道自己想要什么更快>

317
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
Yeah and our current models don't actually cope with it <目前的模型实际上并不能应对它>

318
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
We have to overcome this<我们必须克服这一点>

319
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,560
I smuggle the alcohol I kept for my stuff out of the office one night<有天晚上我把办公室里的酒精偷偷带出了办公室>

320
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,216
And then we have meetings in hotels which would charge of to meeting space and wouldn't mention the coffee in the alcohol<然后我们在酒店举行会议，这些会议室收费，并且不会提及酒精中的咖啡
>

321
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
So that was fairly easy<所以这很容易>

322
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,664
It got worse They banned us for buying food from staff Anybody been in Widnes corporate environments<接下来变得更糟，他们禁止我们在公司环境任何人那购买食物>

323
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,784
Yeah no food may be bought for staff it's a waste of money it's the improper reproach<食物不应该从工作人员那购买，这是浪费钱，这是不正当的责备>

324
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:57,440
By now we've learnt you didn't argue with I being bureaucrats on an evidence base<到现在为止，我们已经知道你并没有因为官僚的基本证据而争辩>

325
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,792
From the perspective of customer or employee need that wouldn't work<从客户或员工需求的角度来看，这是行不通的>

326
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,936
The only thing which occasionally work was the Socratic technique if anybody knows their philosophy<如果有人知道他们的哲学，那么偶尔工作的唯一事情就是苏格拉底式的技巧
>

327
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
It was Socrates did was to ask people questions until they tore themselves apart on there own contradictions<苏格拉底确实是在向人们提出问题，直到他们在自己的矛盾中脱颖而出>

328
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:21,504
It's an extremely enjoyable process you get train to do it in philosophy I enjoyed it thoroughly<这是一个非常令人愉快的过程，你可以通过哲学来训练它，我非常喜欢它
>

329
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
But you always have to remember that eventually the people of Athens get together and decide they had enough for your corrupting the Young<但你总是要记住，当你摧毁他们的年轻人时，雅典人收购了会聚在一起>

330
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,256
And vote for you to take hemlock all right so you have to be careful on this one<并投票给你，所以你必须小心这个
>

331
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Anyway so that's what we did<这些就是我们所做的>

332
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:40,192
So we said ok this is a brilliant move we would never have thought of banning food for staff<这是一个我们永远不会想到禁止员工食物的明智之举
>

333
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
This is one of the benefits of joining IBM<这是加入IBM的好处之一>

334
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,616
And then you realise because they look pleased that irony is a deadly weapon<然后你意识到他们看起来很高兴这样的讽刺是一种致命的武器>

335
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:53,504
You can switch on and off with HTML code here inside chats during conference calls<您可以在电话会议期间在聊天内部使用HTML代码打开和关闭>

336
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832

The high you get promoted

340

The last chance you are of ever having a good relationship with a customer<您与客户建立良好关系的最后机会>

341
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,312
Because you're the poor side gets thrown the problems when they finally stop trying to solve It for themselves<因为当他们最终停止尝试为自己解决问题时，面对被抛出的问题你是弱势的一方>

342
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
And give up the right side in that position<在这种情况下放弃站在正确的一侧>

00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,640
Was collected in case you needed them<收集起来以备不时之需>

385
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,272
If you over constrained system which can't be naturally constrained<如果你过度约束一个自身不接受约束的系统>

386
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
People work around it<人会找到应对之策>

387
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,440
And actually if that's a key issue in system design<实际上这是系统设计中的关键漏洞>

388
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,560
People will work around the system they won't follow the pattern if it doesn't work for me<如果它对我不友好，人们将在系统中找到不遵循约束的应对之策>

389
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:55,424
So there's nothing wrong with hardly constrained or they provide you don't take it to excess<所以几乎没有约束没有什么不妥，或者不要约束过度>

390
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
The chaotic system<混沌的系统>

391
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,800
In my language is a system without constraints<用我的话说是一个没有约束的系统>

392
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
or rather without effective constraints<或者没有有效的约束>

393
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
That means there's no structure to it<这意味着它没有结构>

394
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Everything is random<一切都是随机发生>

395
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,856
which actually means if it happens accidentally it's a major crisis but it will never last for long<这实际上意味着如果它发生意外这是将是一场重大危机，但它永远不会持续很长时间>

396
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,232
If you can deliberately create the conditions you have a hugely powerful tool<如果你可以刻意创造条件，你就拥有了一个非常强大的工具>

397
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
Where can I get the working on North Korea<我在哪里可以得到朝鲜的工作>

398
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
Where are we presenting infographics to tens of thousands of people<我们在哪里向成千上万的人展示信息图表>

399
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Getting in to interpret them in real time<尝试实时解释它们>

400
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,840
Enjoying the Max from the interpretation so we can show out outlier opinions, dominant opinions and various aspects<从解释中得到最大享受，我们能表达不同意见、主流意见及不同角度的意见>

401
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
The reason we can do that is there is no connection no constraint<我们能做到这一点的原因是没有连接没有约束>

402
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,528
Between any of the agents making a decision<在做出决定的任何代理人之间>

403
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah if you can actually remove all constraints you can get radical innovation<如果你真的可以去除所有约束，你可以获得激进的创新>

404
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
So chaos as advantages<所以混沌就成为了优势>

405
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
it takes a lot of energy to create it<它需要花费很多精力创造它>

406
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
Most human systems are complex<大多数人类系统都很复杂>

407
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
That means they have what they call enabling constraints<这意味着他们拥有所谓的启用约束？？？>

408
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
And the whole point about a complex system<复杂系统的重点>

409
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,264
Is it it doesn't have linear causality<它没有线性因果关系>

410
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
it has dispositionality<它有适应性>

411
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
It means I can make statements about how it's disposed to evolve<这意味着我能够讲述它如何发展>

412
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,784
But I can never say if I do X it will always produce Y result<但我永远不会说如果我做事情X它总会产生结果Y>

413
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,648
It's sometimes known as the science of inherent uncertainty<它有时被称为不确定性科学>

414
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,280
Is the science of systems in which there is no linear relationship between cause and effect<系统的科学是因果关系，没有线性关系>

415
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
All that we have is dispositional States<我们所拥有的只是趋势>

416
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,496
Now the key thing which goes with this is dependent on what type of system you're in you will manage in a different way<与此相关的关键取决于您所处的系统类型将以不同的方式管理
>

417
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
And
