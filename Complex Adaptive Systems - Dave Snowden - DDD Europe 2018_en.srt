1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Thank you

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,000
I think my job today is to introduce to new ways of thinking the new concepts so I thought I'd start you off with the picture right.

3
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,224
This is from... and I'm hoping this will work

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,500
This mounting here is called ...

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
About two or three people died on it every year

6
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,256
Partly because they don't take it seriously, it's only just 3000 feet. yeah

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,912
But that's a territory I'm going to come back and reference that in a minute but that's kind like where I grew up that's what I feel at home

8
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,216
now which is another concept that I'm going to come to

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,616
Now what I want to do today is to introduce some new ways of thinking some new ideas to move things forward

10
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
I want to start off by some thoughts on language

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,320
You may or may not have grown up with Winnie the Pooh if you're British you did

12
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,904
And you find the Disney version quite a appalling right

13
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:07,584
But there's a whole sort of structural trope which goes on on the web of people using Winnie the Pooh pictures with favorite sayings

14
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,960
And you look at both of these, right you have to be a Star Trek fan to understand the second

15
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,568
The reference to the episode of Monk and the use of metaphor

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,200
We use very complex metaphors to explain various complex ideas in Simple Words

17
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,064
Also language change is very very quickly if you look at the left-hand one

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,464
It's almost getting out of date now because the level of stupidity is gone even before above that alright or below that

19
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
But the actual context of that and the subtlety of all the messages and all the stories that lie behind it

20
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
Goes way beyond traditional methods of codification

21
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,592
So I can start think about language a bit and this goes back to a quote from the philosopher Martin heidegger

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm sorry about this but when he was writing I should I can't change his language to say woman and man or whatever but he basically said

23
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368
Man thinks he's a master of language but actually language is the master of Man

24
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,208
And the important thing to realise is the language you speak

25
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Largely determines how you see the world

26
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
Yeah I'm getting the language right is there for key

27
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,192
And it isn't just the fact that my first degree in physics and philosophy joint honours

28
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,312
Which give me a Desire for simplicity and purpose in beauty and lots of the stuff

29
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
And language is actually quite important

30
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,296
Now in order to fully understand this what I want to do is come back to this particular picture

31
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Yeah and start to think about a couple of things

32
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,744
First of all I want to make a distinction between sense-making with a hyphen

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
And sensemaking as one word in the original

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,448
For those of you are familiar with calverts working if you haven't read that I recommend it

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
He talks about sensemaking

36
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,592
But it comes from an academic tradition where you study cases

37
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,456
I'm from cases you derive Theory you should all be better to be fully familiar with that

38
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
It's an empirical approach

39
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,368
Sensemaking which is myself climbing others comes from a different perspective

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,184
It says what do we know from natural science

41
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,024
And how do we apply natural science to human systems

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
And use that to create a different level of certainty

43
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,216
The reason we do that is natural science can replicate his experiments

44
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Social science can't

45
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,128
And I'll come back and validate that in a minute just come make a background of the key distinction

46
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
The next key distinction I make which is not used to efficiently

47
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
It's between typologies and taxonomies

48
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,672
Data taxonomy people are familiar with we liked put things into categories

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
The problem is that in English taxonomy rhymes with taxidermy

50
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,120
And produces very similar results

51
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,984
Over rigid structures in which the boundary conditions become very dangerous

52
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,824
Because you make things fit into space even if they don't

53
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,248
I'm a typology on the other hand is a way of looking at things from different perspectives

54
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,088
Now I'm going to be mainly today talking about typologies

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,440
Looking at things from different perspectives to actually make sense of the world

56
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
rather than try and create rigid classifications

57
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
And then we get into the stuff we were talking about in the bar last night

58
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,447
Which is the whole issue of map Models and frameworks

59
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,287
And he's often get conflated or confused

60
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,127
So I'll give you my basic distinctions at the moment yeah

61
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
A model seeks to represent the world

62
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,295
I'm going to come back later from a complexity perspective

63
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,183
And quote Murray gell-mann The only valid model of a human system is the system itself

64
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Now that starts to give us problems

65
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,399
A model seeks to represent the world and we see this a lot in systems architecture in elsewhere

66
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
And then people work within the model framework

67
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
But the trouble is there are limits to the application of models

68
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
It doesn't mean they're not useful but we need to be careful

69
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
A framework on the other hand is generally a typology

70
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,551
It's a way of looking at things from different perspectives so you can make distinctions

71
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
And therefore by those making distinctions do things in different ways

72
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,023
And then a map gives you somewhere placing yourself of understanding where you are

73
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:30,239
So this is the actual map of the area that you show the picture of earlier, this is the Nun frakkin egwin Valley this ribbon

74
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:35,103
You can see a bit, now that's a 1:25000 scale map

75
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,455
It's a really good planning map you're not going to make any major mistakes on that

76
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
That you can see the tracks you can see the contour lines

77
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,183
Now most of us if we're walking there use HARVEY maps Which work on  1:40000 scale

78
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,071
If you actually look at that that's been designed very specifically for walkers

79
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,703
It's got much more detail on it you can actually see where there a cliff somewhere there aren't

80
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,079
The golden rule if you have a walk on the way， if you get lost， stay to the crest

81
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,151
It may be scary but you won't die

82
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,527
If you try and take a short cut you'll die right in terms of cliff

83
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,927
And of course no matter how familiar you are with Maps you can make mistakes the danger with Maps as you become overconfident

84
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,839
We don't read them again we see forward If I go back to roughly this time. last year I made exactly that mistake on the top of tripping

85
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
with that net result in 8 stitches yeah

86
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:37,823
So Maps don't design that should never taken a selfie. the family never forgave me for that

87
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
I said I realised it was bad I fell over on the top and I walked down the field I'll just take a picture before I wash my head

88
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Go and give a lecture at the university

89
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,367
And took the picture and realise oh my god I'm gonna have to go to hospital

90
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
And then the perfect tweet came to mind. Red door on tripping so that kept me going to the bottom because I really wanted

91
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
The tweet with the picture

92
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
And shall we say cause some problems

93
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:08,543
The point is that Maps give you a starting point but you still got to be careful and familiarity breeds contempt

94
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
I'm trying to create some basic language at the moment

95
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,015
The other points and this is one of the biggest issues I see with architecture and elsewhere this is from an Mount Pendleton

96
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,159
Julian a good friend of mine and she's currently actually just about to publish a new book with John Seely Brown on design

97
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,023
Working with us on an complexity approach to design thinking with Stanford University

98
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
I may come back to that a bit later

99
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
She says and this is a critical point the whole point about scaffolding is you take it away when you've completed the building

100
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,847
Get the scaffolding isn't the endpoint it's a means to an end

101
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,455
one of things I see far too much within the whole of the IT industry

102
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Is a focus on scaffolding as the end

103
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
In fact often it's the way the truth and the life

104
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,927
Yet methods are elevated to the level of religion

105
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Yeah I need a allergy in terms of the way it works

106
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
Has somebody's just launched a new approach to business agility

107
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
And guess what the approach is a two-day course with a certificate at the end of it

108
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,519
That's a level of trivialization we're now getting to

109
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,359
So understanding that is key the other thing to

110
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
realize is that there are no recipes

111
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,783
I'm going to justify this more as I come onto complexity

112
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
And I want to make a key distinction between a recipe book user and a chef

113
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
A recipe book user follow the recipe

114
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:36,351
If I have all the right equipment and all the right ingredients there's no problem it works

115
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,167
But if anything goes wrong

116
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
They haven't got the ability the resilience to adjust

117
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,151
A chef on the other hand can make a brilliant meal with whatever they have to hand

118
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,039
And the reason is they have two types of knowledge would Aristotle called phronesis and Sophia

119
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
They have the theoretical knowledge of taste

120
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
And the practical knowledge about apprenticeship

121
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,047
And it's the combination of 4 or 5 years of apprenticeship

122
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,887
With deep Theoretical knowledge about the nature of food

123
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,983
It's the combination which gives them resilient it's not one or the other

124
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,103
And at the moment we turn people to argue for theory or practice or practice of a theory

125
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
And that's a mistake we need to build more chefs and fewer recipe book uses

126
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:29,343
So I want to do is to go through three basic bits of Science and then start to apply them

127
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,183
First is the reality of the way that human beings perceive things

128
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,815
A second thing is how do we create novelty this is going to be really important

129
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,911
Because we try and remove accidents in system design

130
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,519
When actually in the history of evolution accidents of the most important thing

131
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
It's called serendipity if you want the English language word for it

132
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
I'll go through that again finally

133
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:00,063
We can't predict your model and that's what I introduce complexity theory and runs for the Keynesian framework

134
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
For the first in terms of perception

135
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
And this experiment which is been repeated many times

136
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:13,887
If anybody comes to you and says I've done for a pi projects let me tell you from my experience this is what you should do

137
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
They really don't understand the Core Science

138
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,103
If they do three projects which partly succeed and create a worldwide method and accreditation scheme on it

139
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
And that's called snake oil salesman and charlatan

140
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
And there's a lot of them around at the moment

141
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:36,415
Fundamentally if you give a batch of radiologists， Now remember radiologists are coming off of 4 to 5 generation body of knowledge

142
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,791
This is important to realise architecture it's probably a 3 generation body of knowledge

143
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,887
Doctors are a 5000 generation body of knowledge

144
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:52,543
As more generations build knowledge, practice gets built into the processes the training

145
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
You got more reliabilit

146
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
That's a radiologist have a full five generation body of knowledge

147
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
are dealing with the limited information set

148
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,343
Yeah in a controlled environment and most of them I got 10 or 15 years training

149
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
If you give them a batch of X-rays and ask them to look for anomalies

150
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
On  one of the x-rays you hide a picture of a gorilla which is 48 times the size of an average cancer nodule

151
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
83% don't see it

152
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
Even though the right physically scanner

153
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,591
We do not see What we do not intend to see

154
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,687
We actually only see what we expect to see

155
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,087
And the scary thing is the 17% to do see it  come to believe they were wrong

156
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
When they talk with the others

157
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,071
Alright now that one slide undermines any approach

158
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,935
Based on anybody observing what other People do

159
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,567
Because if you're an academic or a consultant to you going steady companies

160
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,151
You only see what you expect to see

161
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
That's just life

162
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,295
It's called confirmation bias in attentional bias in Inception

163
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,391
Such Simon is being berating management textbooks most of this week

164
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:17,535
I'm quite pleased about this I normally the nasty going the internet is now becoming even nastier so that's good news

165
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:26,495
Except I think he's been generous.  I haven't yet seen a single popular management textbook Which actually didn't Commit This fundamental error

166
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,591
Yeah they go and observe things, the interview people

167
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
They believe what people say when they're interviewed inform that they construct method

168
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,527
The good news on this is there's a huge amount there at to be discovered

169
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
If we architect systems in the right way

170
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,671
But we won't know What we need until we discover it

171
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,791
It is the the second thing key aspects from evolutionary biology

172
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
This is called exaptation

173
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
I know we had a general problem with creationist will we still have a problem in the states which is growing right

174
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:07,967
We thought we'd eliminated that's everything and I think is now 52% of people in the United States believe the world was created in the last 6000 years

175
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Which is really scary

176
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,087
I'm doing work with Ebola management teams in Dallas

177
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,463
And I was told I couldn't talk about evolution because it's a controversial Theory

178
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,815
And that's it your Ebola management teams, all right this gets really scary

179
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,215
Yeah but we did have a general problem with it because there isn't enough time in the evolutionary timescale

180
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
The human intelligence to have evolved

181
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
On a linear basis it just won't work

182
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
The other side of crude Neo-darwinian night near darwinian ISM

183
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
A people like Richard Dawkins in the light

184
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,855
with its linear approach it's causal approach actually just doesn't work we got a problem

185
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,743
Then with Robin Hood linksmi Gorgon others we discovered a thing called acceptation

186
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
two illustration of that

187
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,143
Dinosaurs feathers evolved for warmth we can see it in the fossil record

188
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
It's over a long period of time

189
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,031
Yeah it's kind of like Dinosaurs with no feathers or warmer

190
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,383
Therefore they survive more to breed that's a classic adaptation linear process

191
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,527
And then by luck and it turns out the actual evolution isn't survival of the fittest. it's survivor the luckiest

192
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Something into that in Darwin's notebooks but he says this is too going too far so decide not to say it

193
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,975
Is that to be true

194
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,863
there's an arboreal species of dinosaurs because it's cold at the top of tree so you get more feathers

195
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,191
But you also fall from trees

196
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,079
Which means you learn to fly Actually flight is a nonlinear

197
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Acceptation

198
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
A trait which evolved for one function and the stress

199
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
Exit through different functions

200
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,903
I couldn't handle anyway because if dinosaurs threw themselves off trees in the hope of evolving feathers before they hit the ground

201
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,559
The timescale for breeding is very short and the consequences are quite dangerous

202
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,350
of course once you've got acceptation you get adaptation

203
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,727
I was tracked by the bikes not so many months ago

204
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
By a tawny owl who actually literally followed me from mild and a bit of queues it was fascinating experience at dusk

205
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,455
And you can't hear an owl fly

206
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:21,343
Because of feathers have involved silence that's just literally can't hear them absolutely silent flight

207
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,927
So after accepting you get adaptation

208
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,023
But the adaptation is based on where it started

209
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,655
There's any design in this the starting point determines the path way forwards

210
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
You should stop at the scene where I'm going with some of the stuff now

211
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,895
At the other one I love it's a cerebellum at the base of your brain evolved to manipulate muscles in fingers

212
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,247
It accepts in humans to manage the control of grammar in language

213
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
So huge sophistication of human language

214
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,183
was a radical repurposing not a linear adaptation

215
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
If you don't think that's relevant

216
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,351
Then look at what connects the magneto of a radar machine

217
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
A Hershey bar and a microwave oven

218
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
In 1945 a racing engineer

219
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:17,407
Maintaining the Magneto of a ride-on machine noticed that a chocolate bar melted in the pocket

220
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
Now 99 out of 100 engineers you notice this would swear and have their trousers cleaned

221
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,671
This guy realises significance

222
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
And we got microwave ovens

223
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
If you look at the history of technology

224
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,143
It's a history of exaptive moments a radical repurposing

225
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
Some of the stuff I'll talk about in the strategy session with Simon later on this afternoon

226
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:51,199
Is if you look at it you get first mover advantage by repurposing existing technology for novel purpose

227
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
IBM does it with punch cards

228
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,111
Microsoft does it with software developer for IBM

229
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
An apple does it with next after next went bankrupt

230
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
Get the radical evolution of a new apex predator

231
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,143
Is generally based on radical repurposing of an existing technology

232
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
Under conditions of stress

233
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:17,055
Who won the big things when they're starting to work on in terms of Architecture and design

234
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Is how do you design for serendipity

235
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
Serendipity is a wonderful English word it comes from Earth

236
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
Ancient I think Italian story retold by Walpole

237
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,415
About the Two Princes Of serendipity Who get sent on quests

238
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
And they never found what they were looking for

239
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
But they find more useful things instead

240
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
That and that's called serendipity

241
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
And reality is human invention human inside human understanding

242
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,335
Is generally accepted not additive

243
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,711
But that architectural structures tend to be drawn from engineering diagrams

244
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Not from ecosystem

245
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
That's the big thing I'm going to start to argue for

246
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,903
Need to start to think about human systems is a complex psychology

247
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
Not a something which can be reduced to an engineering diagram

248
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Because that reduces much of the richness

249
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
It's leads me onto complexity

250
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
I need a some of the most misused words that we know about

251
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,151
Complexity is a knotty problem and people use complex and complicated in the same way

252
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,247
And people make statements like they want to reduce complexity

253
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
And I'm sorry about this for future speaker but complexity doesn't fail

254
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,159
The nature of a complex system is it always fails

255
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Now again

256
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,559
The failure is actually quite important and I'll come back and describe that

257
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,423
When you architect the complex system you design it for early failure

258
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,519
Big is only through of your failure could you discover what's possible anyway

259
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,871
So let me go through and build on this

260
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,015
So basically we have three types of system in nature, ordered systems, complex systems and chaotic systems

261
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,599
I'm going to define these in terms of constraints

262
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
An ordered system is highly constrained

263
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:16,351
There's very little degree of freedom is very little ability for anything to do anything outside The rules

264
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,703
That you don't see these in nature by the way then work more less unique to human beings

265
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
An example I often give is an operating theatre

266
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:30,687
In an operating theatre we now count the number of surgical instruments left at the end of an operation

267
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,503
And jackets the same as were there at the start

268
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,623
Yeah as I get older I think this sort of stuff is of increasing importance

269
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,767
Yeah I know how many people had to have a second operation because surgical instruments will left in the body

270
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,143
That is actually over 10% on average across the world before the checklist were introduced

271
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,287
If you ever been into an operating theatre it's pretty goddamn messy it's easy to lose things alright

272
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
And the trouble is that losing things inside somebody's body

273
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
Has major consequences yes the order is good

274
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
But the cost of that is high

275
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,879
When a doctor or a nurse goes into an operating theatre anybody been into an operating theatre vertically

276
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,047
I've been in once horizontally in twice vertically alright and I almost got divorced I need to the vertical locations

277
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,471
occasions my two children were both to quote William Shakespeare from their mother's womb untimely ripped

278
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
Said it was Cesarean section

279
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,407
The trouble is I grew up in a veterinary household with animals being detected on the kitchen table over breakfast

280
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,039
So from my point for your Cesarean section was a really interesting operation and can I look more closely

281
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:43,391
And I forgot that was meant to be there for the purposes

282
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,047
But either way if you go to into the operating theatre you go through some elaborate ritual of washing up

283
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,215
What that does Is？ it's a ritual cognitive activation is what ritual does for humans

284
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,335
It aligns the individual To the role that they are occupied

285
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
The reason you don't see what you don't expect to see is at best your scanning 3% of what's in front of you

286
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
And matching it against dominant patterns based on recent experience

287
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,696
What ritual does is to change their patterns

288
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
So you see the world differently

289
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,072
We are playing with experiments with software testers

290
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,912
I'm getting them to change clothes before they test their code

291
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,520
Because you actually want me to have a different cognitive activation pattern

292
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
From me I develop this it's going to work

293
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
Into the sort of testing and support type environments

294
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Ritual is used extensively in military environments

295
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
So that's good Valuable

296
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,832
The trouble is we then take it to excess

297
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
I work for IBM for 7 years

298
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,488
I hasten to add I was conscripted I didn't volunteer

299
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,656
It worked out quite well for me I'm still proud of the fact I didn't fill out a timesheet in 7 years that's a World record breath

300
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:04,544
It takes a level of defiance which are here even I didn't think I was capable but I managed it

301
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
And I managed to avoid the school cross country run for 9 years so I think you know that was a slightly better achievement alright

302
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,368
Either way that took me more about bureaucracy than anything else I can remember

303
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,280
They take us over we were in Anglo Dutch company called data Sciences we had a flat management hierarchy

304
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
Everybody knew everybody else kind of like we got things done and

305
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,656
And then we became part of the world's largest Bureaucracy

306
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,752
And the first thing they did was to charges for coffee and buying alcohol

307
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:40,384
Now this is completely unreasonable the alcohol coffee cycle

308
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,944
it is critical for good software development

309
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:51,904
Nobody should be expected to talk to users without alcohol first

310
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:57,024
You don't have to sober up to write the code and then you need even more alcohol

311
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,608
Because users never want what you can prove they asked for

312
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,984
When you give them the what they asked what they discover they wanted something else instead

313
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,128
I'm going to come back to that later because also architecture is about dealing with an articulated needs

314
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Not articulated needs

315
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,784
That technology capability is progressing faster

316
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,832
Than user know what to ask for

317
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,416
Yeah and our current models don't actually cope with it

318
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
We have to overcome this

319
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,560
I smuggle the alcohol I kept for my stuff out of the office one night

320
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,216
And then we have meetings in hotels which would charge of to meeting space and wouldn't mention the coffee in the alcohol

321
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
So that was fairly easy

322
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,664
It got worse They banned us for buying food from staff Anybody been in Widnes corporate environments

323
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,784
Yeah no food may be bought for staff it's a waste of money it's the improper reproach

324
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:57,440
By now we've learnt you didn't argue with I being bureaucrats on an evidence base

325
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,792
From the perspective of customer or employee need that wouldn't work

326
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,936
The only thing which occasionally work was the Socratic technique if anybody knows their philosophy

327
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
It was Socrates did was to ask people questions until they tore themselves apart on there own contradictions

328
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:21,504
It's an extremely enjoyable process you get train to do it in philosophy I enjoyed it thoroughly

329
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
But you always have to remember that eventually the people of Athens get together and decide they had enough for your corrupting the Young

330
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,256
And vote for you to take hemlock all right so you have to be careful on this one

331
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Anyway so that's what we did

332
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:40,192
So we said ok this is a brilliant move we would never have thought of banning food for staff

333
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
This is one of the benefits of joining IBM

334
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,616
And then you realise because they look pleased that irony is a deadly weapon

335
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:53,504
You can switch on and off with HTML code here inside chats during conference calls

336
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
so they actually think with we generally like this

337
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,624
I said I got a problem

338
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,768
Yeah I know  C-level executives that means I only see customers when they're very very angry

339
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,072
The high you get promoted

340
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,680
The last chance you are of ever having a good relationship with a customer

341
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,312
Because you're the poor side gets thrown the problems when they finally stop trying to solve It for themselves

342
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
And give up the right side in that position

343
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,968
I got called out it's 4 o'clock in the morning we got a Vax cluster down　

344
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah I got three system programmers in and we've only got three  system programmers left in the entire company understand cluster.

345
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
I'm grateful we still got them

346
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:37,024
We got an emergency service which just has to be up at 9 a.m. in the morning

347
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,632
If we don't have it up we got massive penalty clauses anybody been there with one of those other things

348
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,032
I can't do anything at all technically anymore all I can do is get ready to deal with the customer

349
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,920
Stop other managers interfering with the technical people in fact that's my main role to give them the space

350
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:59,808
And buy them pizza and Coke so they stay awake.  so I can take what do I do if I have to buy them pizza and Co

351
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,184
They looked really worried and I realise they could have made a mistake so I said I did mean Coca-Cola

352
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:16,192
And there was another side relief but I must admit we did start the think about options there don't streamed

353
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:24,128
And they looked at me and I said well ok we understand that may occasionally necessary tell you what it will make an exception clause in the The rules

354
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:28,224
If you get vice presidential approval 48 hours in advance

355
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
You can buy food for your staff

356
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,624
At this point you breathe deeply remember Socratic technique

357
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,464
You say god that's brilliant we really would never have thought of that and

358
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,304
No sarcasm get added to irony as a weapon

359
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,144
What happens on the extremely rare occasion

360
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,752
When we can't get 48 hours notice for major crisis

361
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
You can tell there is a chart

362
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,968
And they look worried about points and now you're the Socratic technique is working so they actually made another exception

363
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,808
Is it OK country general manager approval after the event

364
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,160
Now that is the classic bureaucrat response

365
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
I say yes in a way which means no

366
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
They really are very good at this

367
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:19,424
You know that means your expenses will disappear into the Southbank there'll never be signed

368
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:24,544
And if you complain about it your name will start to appear on the wrong list so right

369
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,384
You don't want to be on those lists out there bad places to be

370
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:35,552
So I gather because I would never do this you understand and nobody I know we're never do this but we did hear rumours about friends

371
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,136
equipment ships remotes from our own business units who did this

372
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,696
Over tipping London taxi drivers

373
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,560
But if you ever tip a London taxi driver they give you a blank receipt

374
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:52,192
The blank receipt was then filled out for the amount of money spent on the pizza and Coke

375
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,080
A parallel set of books for cat so that you could say to the other people can prove

376
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
But they haven't wasted company money

377
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:05,248
And the responsible manager took a book bus and to actually playing for the taxi

378
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
That became widespread

379
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,904
I gave this example at the scrum Alliance conference in Berlin 2 years ago

380
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,464
Free people from IBM run up to me afterwards

381
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,024
And said we're still doing that did you invent it

382
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:24,180
And that's 15 years later

383
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:30,160
Last year in Dubai one of them came up and opened his wallet and showed me all the black receipts

384
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,640
Was collected in case you needed them

385
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,272
If you over constrained system which can't be naturally constrained

386
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
People work around it

387
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,440
And actually if that's a key issue in system design

388
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:50,560
People will work around the system they won't follow the pattern if it doesn't work for me

389
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:55,424
So there's nothing wrong with hardly constrained or they provide you don't take it to excess

390
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,728
The chaotic system

391
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,800
In my language is a system without constraints

392
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
or rather without effective constraints

393
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
That means there's no structure to it

394
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Everything is random

395
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,856
which actually means if it happens accidentally it's a major crisis but it will never last for long

396
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,232
If you can deliberately create the conditions you have a hugely powerful tool

397
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
Where can I get the working on North Korea

398
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
Where are we presenting infographics to tens of thousands of people

399
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Getting in to interpret them in real time

400
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,840
Enjoying the Max from the interpretation so we can show out outlier opinions, dominant opinions and various aspects

401
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
The reason we can do that is there is no connection no constraint

402
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,528
Between any of the agents making a decision

403
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah if you can actually remove all constraints you can get radical innovation

404
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
So chaos as advantages

405
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,720
it takes a lot of energy to create it

406
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
Most human systems are complex

407
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
That means they have what they call enabling constraints

408
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
And the whole point about a complex system

409
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,264
Is it it doesn't have linear causality

410
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
it has dispositionality

411
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:10,432
It means I can make statements about how it's disposed to evolve

412
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:14,784
But I can never say if I do X it will always produce Y result

413
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,648
It's sometimes known as the science of inherent uncertainty

414
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:25,280
Is the science of systems in which there is no linear relationship between cause and effect

415
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
All that we have is dispositional States

416
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,496
Now the key thing which goes with this is dependent on what type of system you're in you will manage in a different way

417
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
And

418
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,866
That's kind like the core concept that you gonna move on to

419
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:42,938
If you're in a complex world

420
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:46,266
You have to manage by creating boundary conditions

421
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:50,106
Running experiments and responding to what happens

422
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:54,202
If you're in an ordered system you can plan and design

423
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,762
And Chaos is something you can use

424
00:30:57,018 --> 00:30:59,066
To get new insight but you want to avoid

425
00:30:59,578 --> 00:31:02,650
and say engineering diagrams always assume order.

426
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:05,978
The ecosystems don't.

427
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:11,098
And this is from Brian Arthur, the guy's first brought complexity into economics

428
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,658
?Rodger? defining book called

429
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,194
The evolution of technology

430
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:19,034
The trouble is even scientists don't like complexity very much

431
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,618
which means you're dealing with systems which have perpetual novelty.

432
00:31:24,154 --> 00:31:25,434
constant change.

433
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:29,786
I sometimes use the metaphor as a children's party to illustrate this:

434
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:36,698
Yeah you wouldn't manager children's party with key objectives, targets, mission goals, project plans and milestones

435
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,746
because everything would go wrong.

436
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:41,818
You can see a more elaborate version of that on the web

437
00:31:43,098 --> 00:31:45,402
That from now we get another couple of Simple Rules

438
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,730
If you want a very simple rule about when something is complex

439
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:52,314
If the evidence supports contradictory hypotheses

440
00:31:53,082 --> 00:31:56,666
and you can't resolve the contradiction within the available time

441
00:31:56,922 --> 00:31:57,946
then it's complex.

442
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:03,322
This is actually where we move into a massive new approach to conflict resolution

443
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:07,930
Because the whole point here is nobody is right or wrong.

444
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:11,770
Because everything we do will change the system anyway.

445
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,890
So something which might be right last time could be wrong this time

446
00:32:17,914 --> 00:32:19,962
Anybody's managed the children's party?

447
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,802
Yeah a football can catalyze a good pattern of play

448
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:25,850
In the outdoors in summer

449
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:29,946
But you really don't want to bounce football in your living room in winter

450
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,762
Because the pattern the play will be radically different.

451
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,042
The context is shifted.

452
00:32:34,554 --> 00:32:36,090
Yeah, and damage will be massive.

453
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:38,650
Yeah, different things will vary in different contexts.

454
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,954
So basically

455
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:43,002
What we now start to do

456
00:32:43,514 --> 00:32:48,378
is we look at every coherent and coherence is a really important word in complexity

457
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,170
comes from Philosophy of science.

458
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:56,314
I can say that evolution is coherent to the facts even though we know it's wrong

459
00:32:56,826 --> 00:32:59,386
whereas creationism is incoherent to the fact.

460
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:05,018
It avoids that you were wrong therefore your hypothesis everything is a hypothesis.

461
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,602
The issue is what's coherent the fact what's incoherent to it

462
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:12,954
So all I have to do is to agree your idea is coherent.

463
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:18,330
I don't have to agree you're right in fact that I can be pretty sure you're wrong but I agree

464
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,122
your argument is coherent.

465
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,194
At which point you get a small amount of resource

466
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,010
to run what's called the safe-to-fail experiment.

467
00:33:27,034 --> 00:33:31,130
But in the complex world you run small safe-to-fail experiments

468
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,970
around every single coherent approach.

469
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:37,274
And then you see what happens

470
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,066
and you stabilize the systems.

471
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:47,770
You understand the complex system
by interacting with it not by analyzing it or modeling it.

472
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,330
I repeat that because it's key.

473
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:53,914
You can't understand the complex adaptive system

474
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,962
through modeling or analysis.

475
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:59,290
You can only understand it by interaction

476
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:01,850
with real-time feedback loops

477
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,154
over multiple agents.

478
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,690
So you don't get cognitive bias.

479
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:07,994
This is kind of like 101 science.

480
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:11,066
And again that's gonna change the way we design and work.

481
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,674
The only thing I can say with absolute certain about a complex adaptive system

482
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:19,514
is that whatever I do will produce unintended consequences.

483
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:23,354
If I show this in Australia everybody gets it straight away.

484
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:25,402
And that's a cane toad

485
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:28,730
introduced to reduce pest is now the dominant pest.

486
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:34,362
Now actually that's important to realize, alright?

487
00:34:34,618 --> 00:34:37,434
If you have a complex system and you intervene,

488
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:40,250
the only thing I can guarantee you

489
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:42,810
is that you'll have unintended consequences.

490
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,162
That means you are ethically responsible for them

491
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,722
This is a big new thing on government.

492
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:53,562
If you do a massive intervention and something happens you didn't expect

493
00:34:54,074 --> 00:34:57,658
Well, sorry it's a complex system unexpected things were gonna happen.

494
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,218
It's your responsibility when they do

495
00:35:01,754 --> 00:35:06,362
which means you want to do smaller experiments in parallel much faster.

496
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,714
so the bad unintended consequences you can destroy

497
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,762
and the good ones you can amplify.

498
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:17,626
Because actually the unintended consequences will be the accepted moments

499
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,930
The discovery of novel ways of working

500
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:23,258
and that's actually quite important in terms of what we all do.

501
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:25,050
So from that

502
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:27,354
we move on to the Cynefin framework

503
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:29,658
and basically

504
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:33,498
the Cynefin framework, by the way, is not drawn like this

505
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:38,618
It's not drawn like this adding that later just to shut me up, alright?

506
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:40,666
It's actually drawn like this.

507
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:49,370
Now it's the whole body of theory behind this but basically you don't want a structured model.

508
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:51,674
Cynefin is a typology

509
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:55,514
and in full used the framework emerges from the data

510
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,818
The framework doesn't proceed the data

511
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,354
That's really important

512
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:02,682
If you give people a categorization framework

513
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:04,730
They'll make things fit the framework

514
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:05,754
even if they don't.

515
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:08,826
So when you're working with sense-making

516
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:13,690
You allow the model boundaries to emerge from the data itself through discovery process

517
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:16,762
And then you can use it and that's a really important distinction.

518
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,346
So basically Cynefin divided all (?) into two

519
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:21,882
spaces where

520
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:23,162
the relationship

521
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:24,698
between causes and effects is obvious

522
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:29,818
So for example in civilized countries we drive on the left-hand side of the road.

523
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:40,058
There's no particular reason for it, I remember when Sweden was civilized until the 1960s.

524
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:46,970
They had a national referendum where the people voted to stay civilized but the government have the sense to ignore the referendum

525
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:49,274
that I'm talking about that example lot at the moment.

526
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,346
Yeah and they moved over to driving on the right

527
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,930
It's not a universal, I mean

528
00:36:56,186 --> 00:36:57,722
Yeah you don't drive on the left

529
00:36:57,978 --> 00:37:01,306
In Sweden if a child runs on the road in the UK

530
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:04,890
If a child runs on the road in front of you. You drive anywhere to avoid them.

531
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,754
So there is still exceptions even in rigidly constrained systems

532
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,082
Are there if you have worked for IBM, it was a bit different. I remember

533
00:37:13,594 --> 00:37:18,714
Something moved on the road in front of me in the middle of a Welsh Mountain Road and I slammed the brakes on if you do

534
00:37:19,226 --> 00:37:25,370
Discovered it was a sheep but the car was a write-off and I phoned up car admin and they said next time kill the sheep

535
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,162
I still slightly worried about that one

536
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:32,282
Yes, it was kind of hard I know where there was a sheep or kid until much later, but never mind

537
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:37,914
So basically an obvious domain we got it we can basically Sense-Categorize-Respond

538
00:37:39,194 --> 00:37:40,986
And we can apply best practice

539
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:43,034
Because there is one right way of doing things

540
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:49,178
We then move into the complicated domain where most engineering approaches set.

541
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:52,762
That's actually where there is a relationship

542
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:55,066
Between cause and effect there is a right answer

543
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:59,930
But it can only be discovered through analysis or by the deployment of the right type of expert

544
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:03,258
Expertise as universal by the way

545
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,586
But at this point we can absolutely trust the expert decision

546
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:11,194
So basically at this point I Sense-Analyze-Respond

547
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:14,778
And I apply good practice not best practice.

548
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,106
Now I'd gonna argue at the moment

549
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:21,434
90% of systems architecture

550
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,250
90% of design sits in that domain.

551
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:29,882
The assumption is there a right hand so we can discover it we can design for it, that's it.

552
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:32,442
I'll qualify that in a minute.

553
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:36,538
We then get if we overconstrained a system here

554
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:38,842
You get this catastrophic failure

555
00:38:39,098 --> 00:38:40,378
Which is why chaos

556
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:42,938
Is a temporary space

557
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,010
And I get out of it by Act-Sense-Respond

558
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:47,290
The good news is

559
00:38:47,546 --> 00:38:48,314
I get novelty

560
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,642
There is nothing like a crisis

561
00:38:52,154 --> 00:38:53,434
to produce innovation

562
00:38:54,714 --> 00:38:58,554
If I did an innovation that is all about starvation pressure and perspective shift

563
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,322
If you look at it

564
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:03,930
when we can't use existing frameworks or existing ways of doing things

565
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,466
Then we get invented

566
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:09,306
Yeah that goes back to the cognitive entrainment patterns earlier

567
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:11,866
So basically I‚Äôll say that we get the complex to me

568
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:13,658
In the complex domain

569
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,010
What I actually do is

570
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:18,778
Probe

571
00:39:19,034 --> 00:39:19,802
Sense respond

572
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,106
But I probe in parallel

573
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,130
Not in sequence

574
00:39:23,642 --> 00:39:24,922
That's really important

575
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,762
Because if I do one thing it will nearly always work

576
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,066
You know about the Hawthorne effect?

577
00:39:32,346 --> 00:39:34,906
Ok that that's

578
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:39,514
Cable manufacturers in New York State 1920 artists scientific management

579
00:39:40,026 --> 00:39:43,610
They increase lighting levels and people became more productive that's good news

580
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:46,170
These days they would now publish book

581
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,194
called Light

582
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,986
The secret to productivity

583
00:39:49,498 --> 00:39:55,130
And have a certificate and training course based on how to switch on and off lights and change light bulbs

584
00:39:55,898 --> 00:40:00,250
Then they had some pretension to be real scientist so they lowered the lighting level

585
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,810
People became more productive

586
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,162
What they actually found is people respond to novelty

587
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:12,794
Anything done which is new with attention will work the first time

588
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:15,354
It doesn't mean it will scale or repeat

589
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:22,266
and you get somebody terrible management books that one of my least favorite at the moment is lean startup if anybody's read that?

590
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:29,178
Guy goes interviews people he know who's been successful as a whole body problems there because the way you remember things if you‚Äôre

591
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:29,946
Successful

592
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:32,762
Is different from the way you remember them if you fail

593
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:38,138
And both of them are different from the way they actually happened, so you can't just what people say

594
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:43,770
I remember saying to him at the conference and did you study the companies who failed and he said no why would we do that

595
00:40:44,794 --> 00:40:49,146
I said we did it when I was in IBM with Dorothy Leonard at Harvard Business School

596
00:40:49,402 --> 00:40:51,706
We discovered all the companies have failed

597
00:40:51,962 --> 00:40:55,546
Did exactly the same things as the companies who succeeded

598
00:40:56,826 --> 00:40:58,362
If yes you had a market

599
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:02,202
So a certain percentage would bound to succeed

600
00:41:03,738 --> 00:41:09,370
And that's the trouble we got this very lightweight research throwing at simplistic recipes it's really dangerous

601
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:13,466
Here we come back to complexity I probe since respond

602
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:16,794
And practice here will effectively be emergent

603
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:18,842
I will always see a pattern

604
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:24,218
Now important thing in the latest version I can even call the liminal version

605
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,242
Looks like this

606
00:41:26,522 --> 00:41:28,314
Secrets to liminal spaces

607
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:33,434
Liminality is a really important concept in anthropology

608
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:37,018
And if you really want to understand humans go and do an anthropology

609
00:41:37,274 --> 00:41:40,346
course, alright? don't go on some cultural conversion course

610
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:42,650
Most anthropologists

611
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:45,466
know more about culture in the first year of studies

612
00:41:45,978 --> 00:41:49,050
than cultural change consultants will now in their entire life Style

613
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,425
Basically liminality is a sense of transition if you put on a mask

614
00:41:55,193 --> 00:42:01,337
there is a point where you start to become what the mask represents but there's a state of transition before you do it

615
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,409
and the liminal concept in software design

616
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:08,249
is about actually not committing until you really have to

617
00:42:09,017 --> 00:42:12,857
The longer you hold things in the state of transition the more options you've got

618
00:42:14,649 --> 00:42:18,489
And actually in software development which is I know far better than architecture

619
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,793
This is actually where things like scrum sit

620
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:27,705
Because they are linear iterations based on a defined requirement with a degree of ambiguity

621
00:42:28,217 --> 00:42:29,497
Therefore we're going to explore it

622
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:34,105
That's the trouble we eliminate ambiguity too early on

623
00:42:34,361 --> 00:42:37,177
Because we want to restricted set to do linear experiments with it

624
00:42:38,457 --> 00:42:39,993
In a mixed methods approach

625
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:45,113
What we start to do is to say and I‚Äôll use development that same as I know that better

626
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:46,905
here there's nothing wrong with waterfall

627
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:56,889
Absolutely nothing wrong with Hardy structure processes you can use a TOGAF framework you can use rigid frameworks

628
00:42:57,145 --> 00:43:03,289
You know exactly what you‚Äôve got to deliver you know the resource with an acceptable time frames why would you not take a waterfall approach

629
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:08,153
Remember working with Telstra(?) on this and Telstra Jesco and agile

630
00:43:08,665 --> 00:43:11,225
Therefore nobody got promoted unless they were agile

631
00:43:11,993 --> 00:43:14,553
So the waterfall guys rang one year sprints

632
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:20,953
So they could say they were really agile

633
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:24,025
That's sort of things is very very Common

634
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:26,073
Human beings are canny

635
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:27,865
You can't trust the way they use language

636
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:30,425
um, over here

637
00:43:30,937 --> 00:43:34,009
One of the Big Things We Lost in architecture and elsewhere is the concept

638
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:34,777
of time boxes

639
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:37,593
or we got obsessed with two week’s time boxes

640
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:42,201
Certainly, when I was involved in architect in large decision support systems

641
00:43:42,713 --> 00:43:44,505
we would play around with three months

642
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:47,065
With a guaranteed delivery at the end of three months

643
00:43:47,577 --> 00:43:50,905
But we very resource or we’d very delivery

644
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:51,929
To meet the date

645
00:43:52,953 --> 00:43:57,817
I actually gave us a lot of flexibility in definition phase and people looking like forgotten that stuff

646
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:00,121
but it created the right sort of focus

647
00:44:01,145 --> 00:44:06,265
Over here we're experimenting with radically different approaches and I'll just mention three of them

648
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:07,033
At this point

649
00:44:07,801 --> 00:44:11,129
one is we’re now starting to look at an articulated needs

650
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:14,201
Before we even get

651
00:44:14,457 --> 00:44:16,249
to design of any type

652
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:23,929
What we need to do is to surface the unarticulated needs the things that people don't yet know they were what they want

653
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:26,489
So one of the ways we do that

654
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:30,585
Is we get people to interpret all of their technologies into what’s

655
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:32,377
Call high obstruction metadata

656
00:44:33,145 --> 00:44:38,521
We capture continuous narratives from users about day to day frustrations about their work

657
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:41,849
And then we merge the two databases together

658
00:44:42,105 --> 00:44:43,385
and we look at clusters

659
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:45,689
of user anecdotes with technology

660
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:48,249
and say why are those come together

661
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:50,297
And that gives us novel ideas

662
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,393
We actually did this with Philips lighting

663
00:44:54,649 --> 00:44:58,489
taking all of the technology capability customer stories

664
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:00,281
Putting the two together

665
00:45:00,537 --> 00:45:03,609
Five clusters three of which became multi-million dollar businesses

666
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:08,985
what you're doing is you're forcing accepted moments or insights

667
00:45:09,753 --> 00:45:13,593
By moving up to a level of abstraction, remember I started this on language?

668
00:45:14,617 --> 00:45:17,177
Ok if you don't know it we learnt to paint

669
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:19,225
Before we learn to speak

670
00:45:19,737 --> 00:45:20,249
as a species

671
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,601
Art comes before language in human evolution

672
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:31,001
And it turns out art has major evolution advantage it was an accident when it happened

673
00:45:31,257 --> 00:45:34,329
Somebody sketched some pictures on a wall it kind like work for the hunt

674
00:45:34,841 --> 00:45:36,633
But then it started to really work

675
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:39,193
But if you move up a level of abstraction

676
00:45:39,705 --> 00:45:42,009
You make connections in completely novel ways

677
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:44,313
Engineers

678
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,361
Who actually are musicians

679
00:45:46,873 --> 00:45:49,945
Will tell you they have their best problem-solving capability

680
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:51,225
When they play music

681
00:45:52,761 --> 00:45:55,321
Art is critical to human invention

682
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:58,393
It's why the problem with STEM education is really scary

683
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:01,721
Because we are reducing human beings down to the level of the art

684
00:46:03,257 --> 00:46:07,353
Other stuff we doing this is about to start with the University of California San Diego

685
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:10,425
And this is actually much more about infrastructure management

686
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,985
If you come to the university to do computing

687
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:17,849
You have to form a trio with somebody from the humanities and somebody from the pure sciences

688
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:20,665
on your given task by the University every three months

689
00:46:22,457 --> 00:46:26,809
What we're doing is building a cross silent(solo?) network of people who focus on a task

690
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:30,393
So that we can bring things together in novel or unexpected ways

691
00:46:31,673 --> 00:46:36,025
And a lot of this is about creating an architecture for Discovery

692
00:46:36,537 --> 00:46:39,097
rather than creating an architectures to deliver

693
00:46:39,353 --> 00:46:40,121
What people have asked for

694
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:43,705
Did you get the discovery architecture right

695
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:45,753
The recipe comes a lot easier

696
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:48,825
Because you’ve got actually more structure in terms of the way you work

697
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:53,945
I could go on on that but there's a lot more material that which I can move on to

698
00:46:54,457 --> 00:46:56,761
The key thing I want to finish off is this question and modelling

699
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:00,345
Are you a fine people in complexity theory

700
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:03,673
This is what I call the computational complexity guide(?)

701
00:47:04,185 --> 00:47:05,977
My field is called down through complexity

702
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:08,025
And the study of complexity in human systems

703
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:11,609
The computational guide(?) think everything is like birth locking

704
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:15,705
You know but it's flock around in skies called boys algorithm

705
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,521
It's follow the next bird max speed avoid collision

706
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,337
and that also works by the way if you want

707
00:47:21,593 --> 00:47:23,129
To drive south of Naples in Italy

708
00:47:23,897 --> 00:47:28,761
It's a much more effective heuristic than following the rules, alright? if you match speed avoid collision

709
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:35,417
Yeah and follow the next car you actually have a stress field driving experience even in Sorrento if you assume they’ll follow the rules

710
00:47:35,673 --> 00:47:36,441
forget it, alright?

711
00:47:36,953 --> 00:47:37,977
That's not the way it works

712
00:47:38,745 --> 00:47:40,537
The trouble being that human beings aren’t ants

713
00:47:40,793 --> 00:47:43,097
Because we haven't got, you know, you can predict

714
00:47:43,353 --> 00:47:45,657
The entire complexity of the termites nest

715
00:47:46,681 --> 00:47:51,545
This is genetically encoded rules responding consistently to (?) them stimulation

716
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,129
The human beings can see things through metaphors

717
00:47:55,897 --> 00:47:57,177
We see things for abstraction

718
00:47:57,945 --> 00:48:03,577
We can change identity overnight when I'm with my children I'm a completely different person than on stage

719
00:48:04,857 --> 00:48:09,465
We don't have single agency we don't have single rules with complex pattern-based creatures

720
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:12,025
So, basically, human beings aren’t ants

721
00:48:12,793 --> 00:48:15,097
And that means you’ve got a real problem with modelling

722
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:22,521
I gave the keynote at the European complexity conference all academics they said what I speak about why you can't model of Complex Adaptive system

723
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:28,153
I said no problem nobody told me the entire audience will be academics who built models

724
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:34,809
that would like Daniel going into the Lions Den that was when I met Gelman he was the other here

725
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:37,881
And you can't challenge Gelman he’s won the world's most famous physicist

726
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:41,209
He backed me up and said you can't model the human system

727
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:45,817
The only valid model of human system is a system itself

728
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:51,193
A map to some extent is where we're starting to go but it's also part of the general concern

729
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:54,265
About an increase of artificial intelligence

730
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:55,033
Focus on artificial intelligence

731
00:48:56,569 --> 00:49:01,433
This is actually real problems, anybody hasn't ready the IAIN M. BANKS’ book: surface detail?

732
00:49:01,945 --> 00:49:06,553
IAIN M. BANKS is a brilliant science fiction writer, and tragically died of cancer

733
00:49:07,065 --> 00:49:12,441
And he then proposed to his long-term girlfriend by asking her if she would do the honor of becoming his widow

734
00:49:13,209 --> 00:49:16,025
Is that sort of sense of humor, right?

735
00:49:16,793 --> 00:49:21,145
Read that and be terrified I've just been involved in a big think tank in California

736
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:24,729
General Hughes act is actually AI is the second most

737
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,265
Highest existential threat to

738
00:49:26,521 --> 00:49:28,313
humanity after nuclear war

739
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:29,849
And ecological

740
00:49:30,105 --> 00:49:31,385
Change is actually number four

741
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:37,785
where the reason is we’re reducing human beings to information retrieval and process

742
00:49:38,297 --> 00:49:39,577
And AI is better than that

743
00:49:41,113 --> 00:49:43,929
And we won't go on to AI driven more machines and things like that

744
00:49:44,185 --> 00:49:47,513
We need to be very careful about that because a human being is more than this

745
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:50,329
And then of course we get all the culture nonsense

746
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:54,937
Everybody wants to engineer if in doubt blame culture

747
00:49:55,705 --> 00:49:58,521
If your pet project didn't work it was their fault

748
00:49:59,289 --> 00:50:02,617
Because they have the wrong culture or the wrong mindset, now this is

749
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:04,153
Appalling science

750
00:50:05,177 --> 00:50:07,481
There is no such thing as a mindset

751
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,577
There Is a complex set of interactions overtimes in a series of

752
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:12,345
The tropes

753
00:50:12,601 --> 00:50:14,393
But it's not an individual mindset

754
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:19,513
You get people who will gather people’s stories that's good news we gather people’s stories

755
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:20,793
But we let

756
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:23,097
People interpret them themselves

757
00:50:23,865 --> 00:50:27,449
We don't interpret them or let computers interpret them

758
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:29,753
Because that restricts us to text

759
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,825
And by the way you can write down

760
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:35,129
10% of what you know

761
00:50:36,665 --> 00:50:38,969
Anything which is processing text

762
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:42,553
Is again dealing with a very very limited set

763
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,625
There's a power issue here as well

764
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:48,441
Who interprets people's narrative is there

765
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:51,001
This is from work were just doing with the BBC

766
00:50:51,513 --> 00:50:53,305
Weather presenting cartoons

767
00:50:53,561 --> 00:50:56,633
Employees are choosing cartoons which represent their culture

768
00:50:57,401 --> 00:51:00,729
Interpreting those on the high abstraction metadata

769
00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:04,057
and from that we then actually drawing a series of maps

770
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:07,129
And when the reason is we don't want to fall into one of these traps

771
00:51:08,921 --> 00:51:11,993
Yep mansplaining post-colonialism

772
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:15,833
All that lovely word about the expert must be right

773
00:51:16,345 --> 00:51:16,857
Ok

774
00:51:17,113 --> 00:51:18,649
I'm giving you three illustrations there

775
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:21,721
If you really want to understand the human system

776
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:24,793
You’ve got a hand over the power of interpretation

777
00:51:25,305 --> 00:51:26,841
To the people themselves

778
00:51:27,097 --> 00:51:28,889
Does it mean you don't have a role for experts

779
00:51:29,401 --> 00:51:32,729
We got to distribute the cognitive function you can't hold that centrally

780
00:51:33,497 --> 00:51:34,521
So from that

781
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:36,825
That allows us to do some very interest things

782
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:40,921
This example is a dispositional map

783
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:43,993
And this is actually where we are starting to go with systems architecture

784
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:46,041
Also with things like kanban

785
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:48,857
So if you look at categories and Kanban(?)

786
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:52,697
Ok the key Concepts on kanban is working progress

787
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:59,865
Yeah not the representation of those to hear the advocates you would think it was all about Post-it notes moving between columns

788
00:52:00,633 --> 00:52:02,169
Key Concepts is working progress

789
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:06,777
In an ordered system work in progress is a series of discrete job unit

790
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:08,057
So The kanban Works

791
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:12,153
In a complex system is a series of unrealized

792
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:13,177
Potentialities

793
00:52:13,689 --> 00:52:15,481
So the representation has to change

794
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:22,137
This is actually a landscape drawn from mass observation self interpretation at the point of origin

795
00:52:22,649 --> 00:52:26,745
And this is actually a cultural change map so if I actually want to change culture on this one

796
00:52:27,513 --> 00:52:29,561
If my desires Stacey(?) is up here

797
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:33,401
You can see I've got some things up there so

798
00:52:33,657 --> 00:52:34,169
It’s a tick in the box

799
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:36,217
This is very very negative

800
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:38,777
To move them up there as a Step Too Far

801
00:52:40,313 --> 00:52:42,361
What I do instead is I look at this

802
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:44,665
And I say what can I do tomorrow

803
00:52:45,177 --> 00:52:46,457
To create more like these

804
00:52:47,225 --> 00:52:47,993
If you would like those

805
00:52:49,785 --> 00:52:52,601
What I'm doing this is a key principle of complex design

806
00:52:53,113 --> 00:52:55,929
Is I’m shifting the system to an adjacent possible

807
00:52:57,209 --> 00:52:59,513
And once I get enough stability at that point

808
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:01,561
I can use more conventional approaches

809
00:53:02,073 --> 00:53:05,913
This is what I'm talking about architecting to under for discovery

810
00:53:06,169 --> 00:53:07,961
Before you architect for delivery

811
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,545
And if you actually start with the delivery

812
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:13,593
You’ve missed the discovery phase

813
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:15,897
and you’re gonna miss opportunities as well as threats

814
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:18,713
That's actually from a hospital

815
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:22,297
That also allows us a key Concept called fractal engagement

816
00:53:23,065 --> 00:53:28,185
So the same data can produce frameworks at the level of responsibility of every individual

817
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:32,793
And again, I haven't got time to go into this I'll go this in the strategy session

818
00:53:33,305 --> 00:53:36,377
Fractal engagement is the way we actually achieve change

819
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:40,217
People don't make decisions about what other people should do

820
00:53:40,473 --> 00:53:45,081
They make decisions about what they can do tomorrow within their own sphere of competence

821
00:53:46,361 --> 00:53:49,177
Then the system as a whole orientates through multiple actions

822
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,993
That's a big concept I’m just hinting at it now

823
00:53:52,761 --> 00:53:54,553
And that’s what we call fractal change and way

824
00:53:56,345 --> 00:53:57,881
It's also about multiple perspectives

825
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:03,257
This is actually from again this is work on the whole variety of areas.

826
00:54:03,513 --> 00:54:04,793
This is Peace and Conflict resolution

827
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:10,937
What we doing here is presenting in infographic and we are doing this in system design Discovery architecture

828
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:14,521
We’re Representing infographics about where we think we should be

829
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:17,849
We're getting every employee to interpret that

830
00:54:18,105 --> 00:54:22,713
And drawing the maps of the interpretation before anybody talks to anybody else

831
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,321
In that space is actually from Columbia this is

832
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:28,601
Yeah big one

833
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:34,233
You can see that blue and green see the same data in such radically different ways

834
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:37,049
Sitting them down to talk to each other as a waste of time

835
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:40,633
The only thing they both agree on this is they hate the red guys

836
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:43,705
the strategy here

837
00:54:44,985 --> 00:54:47,033
Is there actually make these more extreme

838
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:50,873
So that we get a new consensus in the middle

839
00:54:52,153 --> 00:54:56,249
The other reason we do this is I want to find outlets

840
00:54:57,017 --> 00:54:58,809
Again I talk about Discovery architecture

841
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:04,185
I want to see groups of people who are seeing the world differently from everybody else

842
00:55:04,697 --> 00:55:07,257
Because those are the things the 17%

843
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:09,561
Who seen the Cancer module

844
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:14,425
Rather than people are going with orthodoxy so again that's the concept of Discovery architecture

845
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:15,961
Rather than delivery architect

846
00:55:17,241 --> 00:55:20,313
And the final slide finish off on this How You scale a complex system

847
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:26,713
Again this is a big field, but the one thing you don't do is you never scale the complex adaptor

848
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:27,481
system

849
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:30,041
By aggregation or imitation

850
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:35,161
You don't take everything and aggregated it up into some massive diagram

851
00:55:35,673 --> 00:55:37,977
And you don't say that worked will do more of it

852
00:55:39,513 --> 00:55:45,657
What do you actually do is you decompose things and there's a whole body of working on this, by the way, an object orientation

853
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:47,449
Which some of us are going back to at the moment

854
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:51,289
You decompose things to the lowest coherent object

855
00:55:52,313 --> 00:55:54,873
You define protocols for the interactions

856
00:55:55,129 --> 00:55:55,897
Between the objects

857
00:55:56,665 --> 00:55:59,737
And you allow novel patterns to emerge as you stimulator the system

858
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:05,113
So you sail but scale by decomposition and recombination

859
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:07,417
Not by aggregation

860
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:09,465
And not by imitation

861
00:56:10,489 --> 00:56:13,561
Have a challenge for design the Challenge for architecture

862
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:16,377
Is to move much further back in the cycle

863
00:56:17,145 --> 00:56:19,193
To deal with an articulated needs

864
00:56:20,217 --> 00:56:22,265
To discover on an objective basis

865
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:25,337
Novel possibilities unexpected consequences

866
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,665
And build systems with the responsive capability

867
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,993
To exploit opportunities as they present themselves

868
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:33,529
Before they're fully now

869
00:56:34,553 --> 00:56:38,649
In order to do that we need to have a sound understanding of the science

870
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:40,441
Behind human cognition

871
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:42,745
And the science behind systems

872
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:46,329
Based on the conditions of extreme uncertainty

873
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:50,425
Falling back to the constraints of natural science gives us security

874
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:55,033
Falling back to empirical parsh memories of what work before

875
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,593
Makes us very very vulnerable

876
00:56:58,361 --> 00:56:59,129
Thank you very much for your time
