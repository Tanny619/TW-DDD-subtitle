1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,304
好，还有什么你想改进的吗？

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,584
是的

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,888
你看出来还有不爽的地方吗？

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,728
是的。这里全是过程代码，一个方法，一屏幕高

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,824
做这个，做那个，做这个等等

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,616
就是一些脚本

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:24,832
是的。这里"get the train"就没有用了

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
所以，我们删掉它

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,160
好，现在好多了

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,488
现在，我们的问题是，

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
我们共享了"train"，通常这是要返回领域对象，而不是JSON数据

12
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,984
我们看到我们这里有个物理代理

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
来扩展WebAPI，来组成一个

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,784
适配器，通过适配器模式

15
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
我们还会继续来着这段代码，所以不用担心你不知道。对比返回

16
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,512
JSON字符串。

17
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,560
我们让它返回Train对象。好的。

18
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
这样我们就可以在函数内处理JSON了

19
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:18,592
这样可以更面向领域，不会和技术细节

20
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
纠缠在一起。你觉着呢？同意。你觉着还好？

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,040
所以，我发现这个文件

22
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,344
有一个Train的构造函数

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
Train。好的。我们看到很多反序列化JSON的东西。

24
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,328
这个文件就是这样

25
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,936
这个不要选中吗？

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,872
删掉。好的。

27
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,480
这个也没有用到

28
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
我们也删除它

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808


30
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,648
这个也变灰了

31
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
或者你可以把它分拆到几个文件中.. 嗯，删掉它。

32
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
现在，我们在

33
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
Train

34
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
这个类中

35
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:21,312
是的。Train没有太多的行为，除了

36
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
解析

37
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,200
JSON

38
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
神奇的Resharper

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
好

40
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
我们使用Lambda。好的。好。

41
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,256
我要移动这个了。这里有很多..属性...字段...好。

42
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,400
我们有一个构造函数。全是技术细节了。

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704


44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
你还有什么建议吗？

45
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
如果我来喝点水

46
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
[观众问题]

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,696
这里有个更好的地方来解析JSON

48
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
Train是领域模型的一部分，所以，我们不应该在这里做这件事。

49
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
好吧，让我们来修改。好，我来创建

50
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264
一个小[方法]来封装我要移动的代码

51
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
我们会做很多次的这种操作。抽取，移动。抽取函数，移动到合适的位置。

52
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,784
我们会在会议中多次使用到。好吧，让我们来做第一次。

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
我想选中我要的所有代码

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
来抽取，移动

55
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
这个可以吗？

56
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208


57
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256


58
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024


59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
再多一点？好的，这个，好的。

60
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
代码太长了

61
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:59,616
好的，我们抽取了函数，但是它现在依然是实体函数。好的。

62
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
这个是

63
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Train topology

64
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
因为在解析JSON

65
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
所以，

66
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,344
对Train的很多属性做了赋值

67
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
不错的方法

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
这个吗？

69
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
所以，抽取函数的人

70
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,792
可以把它

71
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:22,144
移动到新的位置

72
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:26,496
一个好的查看依赖的方法。因为我想移动它

73
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,080
但是我不想增加依赖

74
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,128
我知道我想隔离

75
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:32,896
所以

76
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:34,176
我使用了静态函数

77
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,528
现在出现了几个下划线

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,552
几个下划线

79
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:41,344
这里，这里，因为它们是静态的

80
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:48,000
现在我们要修改第二个测试，来看看，是否静态... 出现了错误

81
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:51,584
好的，来看看如何切断这些

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
好的，联系。

83
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:54,656
Results

84
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:07,456
Yeah mate motion answers

85
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,880
Send an apology as an argument

86
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:21,280
Yeah that's a good idea but there is something I can do also it's so far

87
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:25,376
If a is not New Zealand then I increment the results it

88
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:26,400
Instead of

89
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:29,728
Changing that value of cos of sitcom.

90
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:31,776
But we may be able to

91
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,080
Causes of using the potty

92
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:40,480
And everytime I call the property new property is doing the computer desk so many one way of doing it

93
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:41,760
Something

94
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:46,880
Instead of

95
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:52,512
Lezyne v11 changing the value it will be something like

96
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:54,048
Set

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,704
Return on debt collection of sets so that as well not not at work on

98
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:02,240
Don't want

99
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
Not Nero auntie

100
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:06,336
Something like that

101
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,920
Result sorry sir cannot thank you for the match

102
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:12,992
Well for the last rooms

103
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:16,064
Isomorphic artificial Wales

104
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:20,416
Drilling waste collection Andrews email address

105
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,720
It so that's not this not

106
00:06:22,976 --> 00:06:29,120
So here when I was writing something like I think the list of the seats and I can't everything's well that Lundy is very

107
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,168
Ring all's well

108
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:36,800
I don't have a booking at all times his father

109
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:39,104
So now you can get

110
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,128
Rid of that

111
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,432
Familiar

112
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:43,712
And this one

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,504
Maybe I can

114
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:46,528
Next

115
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,576
As you propose something similar

116
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:51,392
ASOS a list

117
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,304
What's an intro song that's made into a fashion I shouldn't because I

118
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,352
Statin function

119
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:02,656
So

120
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:05,728
I was still the oceans furniture

121
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:07,264
I like you

122
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:08,800
List

123
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:14,688
Antalya

124
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:19,552
I received a look-a-like about yesterday now

125
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,344
I return

126
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,976
Sorry, that message into a pension

127
00:07:27,232 --> 00:07:30,304
So that's where we call it we get the results

128
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,328
Direction

129
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:34,912
So since we added strength ability

130
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,728
University because we have to move it

131
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:39,264
What's the population

132
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:45,920
What is the train is because it's because it's running yeah it's a matter of

133
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:54,368
Ok maybe just trying to message you make it

134
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:55,136
Perfect

135
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,440
Function so we can move it

136
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:59,232
Granny off internet

137
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:03,584
Let's put it it will get back to you I haven't eaten

138
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:05,888
Well it has been called

139
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:09,472
Yes

140
00:08:09,728 --> 00:08:13,824
Here we have the train

141
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:19,456
So it may be interesting instead of having no didn't have energy to get the train to return on train

142
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,248
For men you can put that

143
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,296
Study functioning to the tenderness of his

144
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:26,880
So let's move

145
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:34,816
So you must be signed into the train

146
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,376
Weather.co.uk

147
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,752
So far we still have a crown dependency in the

148
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:46,592
In the train class between infinity Motorcycle

149
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,920
So you make it to open each user

150
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,200
Yes and

151
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,528
The goal is to change the Swan

152
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,112
Madrid train and get train at Everton this year show

153
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:02,976
2010 original itasca strings attached before it sank

154
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:07,072
Will requesting a weather API so it's a good offer

155
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,656
I should have died complexity matter

156
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,520
Ok what tree restaurants in Sweden train

157
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:16,544
Maria Bello

158
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,664
For the business not have to take the train or within subject

159
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:25,760
Ok so I'm trying to transform the topology

160
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,928
The trend on deserts of the British weather

161
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:34,208
So we call it that

162
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:37,280
Identification

163
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:39,840
But

164
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:43,680
Currently the train a dog

165
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:45,728
Received

166
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:48,288
Citizens Advice

167
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:54,688
Change that herself still have that lets accepting a list of s*** yeah so it was not the train we will accept it

168
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,992
Mushroom much more easy to

169
00:09:57,504 --> 00:10:00,576
Cliff Richard to play with and remove this phone

170
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:04,928
So we don't have any kind of references from the train to when you can off

00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
What I suggest

223
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,327
Surely it's too

224
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:58,495
Production Gear Jordan to put it in the population in Tritton Leicester or child objects

231
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,863
So what'll we do a lot it's to extract credit

232
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Please type the behavior

233
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,007
Into a method so then you will have a method into the same type

234
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,359
And then we will move it into the population in the train France

235
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,711
At the end of the day would have more actually rating

240
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
Ok

241
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:01,215
This train reserve seats personal analysis the first Middle School attendance should not

242
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
Maximum capacity of the train

243
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
I suggested recycle message here

244
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:12,735
But maybe does not it does not exceed does not exceed

245
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
Overall

246
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855

Diversity

251
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,887
I will make us a non static method and primaquine to be able to move it

252
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Isn't it

253
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,287
So here I strike that two minutes with that method

254
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
Where should I

255
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
Move it

256
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Going to

257
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
The training and everything

258
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
If I said

259
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,295
6 tomorrow

260
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:53,695
Azure Python passing arguments to an instance of an argument so you can easily move that day

261
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,583
Trainer has a train does not exceed over altering capacity

262
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,167
If I want to replace number of seats

263
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Ok

264
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,591
Actually what we have here is available seats

265
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,967
Real building list of available seats at School of Massage Windsor

266
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759

Turn on statistics on solar movies

271
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
So here

272
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:34,399
If the train does not exceed if I request does not exceed the maximum capacity

273
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Where to find sum of elements

274
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Actually

275
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
They said that we may introduce here instead of that

276
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
When you finish

277
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919

A specification

281
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Yes

282
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:04,351
Yeah except of course at the end of the day we will need to try 1800 Portsmouth

283
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,959
Before that's the don't expect was talking a lot about whether I should attend

Set a rear bottom cassette for fine

285
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
So I think it's so sweet

286
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,919
Instead of just dealing with available seats a list of Sith

287
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
There's a vendor distance of possession from that

288

As you can see we have the list of program and the world not matching correctly

303
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
Letters of a gamma camera

304
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
We have to

305
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:49,055

315
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:36,415
Send signature on that by introducing the concept of inheritance

316

412
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:35,423
Instead of

413
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,215

The Mistletoe let's move it into the train

431

So now I can ask the train please try and give me your attention music

432
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,047
Number 68

433
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,119
Get off its food

434
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:38,911
Then I can continue

435
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,823
I can't continue to ASDA booking office and also looking at her she is not part of the domain you said always looking

436
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:47,871
So let's

437
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,431
Stickers of the mend Longridge

438
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:51,967
The Chase

439
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:58,623
And then what we do is to iterate or every citizen resolution attempt to assign materials

440
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:00,927
Maybe we can

441
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:02,719
Attack the messenger

442
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:06,815
And put it into the position and then directly which will be a sign

443
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,351
Booking reference

444
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:11,935
Which one video

445
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:16,543
Which was the

446
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,895
The devil's a dimension is that time of the minute we are signing with initials

447
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:22,943
Designer shirts ok

448
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:25,503

00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:30,367
To move ya love to know that I don't

451
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:31,903
Ok

452
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,231
So we are seeing meteor showers 2010

453
00:25:36,255 --> 00:25:36,767
Ok

454
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:43,679
If we look at the implementation just too funny to fail all we take that looking at house and sign it

455
00:25:43,935 --> 00:25:44,959
To everyone of the seats

456
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:46,495
Of the multinationals

457
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:59,039
I was thinking the same thing as you and the Medics was really saying it

458
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:00,063
We build

459
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:04,415
The process is to build a reservation agent

460
00:26:04,927 --> 00:26:08,511
And at the end of the day to transform it into hibernation

461
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,351
So yes but I wasn't saying that

462
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,935
Idea

463
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:16,959
Regression

464
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:21,823
Actually we thought it's like a technical team builder

465
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:28,479
Used to do it to use it in technical lead for the next concert

466
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:35,647
So we have a train station see what it may be sent to more and you haven't

467
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:38,975
Who is happy fashion within this application of the Year sequel

468
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:44,863
Yeah it's just everywhere let's see if it's irrelevant you ok

469
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:45,631
Rabbit

470
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:48,703
Decoration of the general manager

471
00:26:49,215 --> 00:26:52,543
Then we used to set it into the hospital so intricate Benidorm

472
00:26:53,055 --> 00:26:55,871
Then we clear it interesting

473
00:26:56,383 --> 00:27:02,271
Weekly rates and an unconscious changing the glow in the stretching mediatek Street II

474
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,599
Average average of two figures

475
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:08,927
Total to clear the cache I don't know what to debit

476
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,231
Ok I hope it's worth

477
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,791
And then we said

478
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:14,815
The book

479
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:19,423
English film Olsen the trainer Gok into into the dash

480
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,471
And then that's it

481
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,031
Is that so

482
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:26,079
Attach where we only save stuff

483
00:27:28,127 --> 00:27:33,759
But think about the hour

484
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:34,783
Ivana

485
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,831
Windjammer correctly

486
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:38,623
It's a mistake

487
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:41,951
As we said before we completely older

488
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,231
Khomeini

489
00:27:43,743 --> 00:27:44,255
So

490
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:46,815
Autocar venues self service

491
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,631
And why we cash

492
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:52,191
HR department waiting staff

493
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:53,471
It's a mistake

494
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:57,823
You can change it and say yes it says it's going to stupid

495
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,103
Think I would say

496
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:02,431
Miss Katrina Isabella switch up

497
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:04,479
I remove it here

498
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:07,551
Animals that swim of that sand

499
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:08,575
Hi
