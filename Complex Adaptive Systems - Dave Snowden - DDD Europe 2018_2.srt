1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,816
That's collector Corps concert for gonna move on to

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,888
If you're in a complex world

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,216
You have to manage by creating boundary conditions

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,056
Running experiments and responding to what happens

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:17,152
If you're in an audit system you can plan and design

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,712
And Chaos is something you can use

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,016
To get new insight but you want to invade

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,600
How to say engineering diagrams always assume order

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
The ecosystems.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,048
And this is from Brian Arthur the first book complexity into economics

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,608
Rodger defining book corner

12
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
The evolution of technology

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,984
The trouble is that even scientists don't like complexity very much

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,568
Visit means you're dealing with systems Which have perpetual novelty

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
Get constant change

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,736
I sometimes use the metaphor as a children's party to illustrate this

17
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
Yeah you wouldn't manager children's party with key objectives targets mission goals project plans and milestones

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,696
Because everything would go wrong

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,768
You can see a more elaborate version of that on the web

20
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,352
That from that we get another couple of Simple Rules

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,680
If you want a very simple rule about when something is complex

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,264
If the evidence supports contradictory hypotheses

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,616
And you can't resolve the contradiction within the available time

24
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,896
Then it's complex

25
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,272
This is actually where we move into a massive new approach to conflict resolution

26
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,880
Because the whole point here is nobody is right or wrong

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,720
Because everything we do will change the system anyway

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
There's something which might have been right last time could be wrong this time

29
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,912
Anybody's managed to children's party

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,752
Yeah a football can catalyser good pattern the play

31
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,800
In the outdoors in summer

32
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,896
But you really don't want to bounce football in your living room in winter

33
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Because the pattern the play will be radically different

34
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
The context of shifted

35
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
Yeah and damage will be massive

36
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
Yeah different things work well in different context

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
So basically

38
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
What we know stuff to do

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,328
Is we look at every coherent and coherence is a really important word in complexity

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
Camps and Philosophy of science

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,264
I can say that evolution is coherent to the fact even though we know it's wrong

42
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
Where's creationism is incoherent to the fact

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,968
It avoids that you were wrong therefore your hypothesis everything is a hypothesis

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,552
The issue is what's coherent the fact what incoherent to it

45
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,904
So we'll have to do is to agree your idea is coherent

46
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,280
I don't have to agree you're right in fact that can be pretty sure you're wrong but I agree

47
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
Your argument is coherent

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,144
At which point you get a small amount of resource

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
To run what's called the safety foil experiment

50
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,080
Been in the complex world you run small safe to fail experiments

51
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
Around every single coherent

52
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Approach

53
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
And then you see what happens

54
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
And you stabilizer systems

55
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
You understand the complex system

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
By interacting with it

57
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
Not by analysing it

58
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Or modelling it

59
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
I repeat that because it's key

60
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,864
You can't understand the Complex Adaptive system

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Through modelling or analysis

62
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,240
You can only understand it by interaction

63
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
With real-time feedback loops

64
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
Over multiple agents

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
So you don't get cognitive bias

66
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
This is going like 101 science

67
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
And again that's going to change the way we design and work

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,624
The only thing I can say with absolute certain about a Complex Adaptive system

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,464
Is there ever I do will produce unintended consequences

70
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,304
If I show this in Australia everybody gets it straight away

71
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
And that's a cane toad

72
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
Introduced to reduce pest is now the dominant pest

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,312
Naturally that's important to realise it's alright

74
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,384
If you have a complex system and you intervene

75
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
The only thing I can guarantee you

76
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
Is it you'll have unintended consequences

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
That means you are ethically responsible for me

78
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
This is a big new thing on government

79
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,512
If you do a massive intervention and something happens you didn't expect

80
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,608
Oh sorry it's a complex system unexpected things were going to happen

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,168
It's your responsibility when they do

82
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:29,312
Which means you want to do small experiments in parallel much faster

83
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,664
So the bad unintended consequences you can destroy

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,712
And the good ones you can have T4

85
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:40,576
Is actually the unintended consequences will be the accepted moments

86
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,880
The discovery of novel ways of working

87
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:46,208
And that's actually quite important as what we all do

88
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:48,000
Save from net

89
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,304
We move onto the Canavan framework

90
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:52,608
And basically

91
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,448
At the camera framework by the way is not drawn like this

92
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:01,568
It's not drawn like this adding that later just to shut me up

93
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,616
Is actually John like this

94
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:12,320
No the whole body of theory behind this but basically you don't want a structured model

95
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:14,624
Canavan is a typology

96
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:18,464
And in full use the framework emerges from the data

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,768
The framework doesn't proceed the date

98
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,304
That's really important

99
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,632
If you give people a categorisation framework

100
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:27,680
Don't make things fit the framework

101
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:28,704
Even if they don't

102
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:31,776
It's the one you're working with sensemaking

103
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:36,640
You like the model boundaries to emerge from the data itself through Discovery process

104
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:39,712
And then you can use it and that's a really important distinction

105
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,296
The basically Canavan divided into 2

106
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:44,832
Spaces where

107
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,112
The relationship

108
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,648
Between cause and effect is obvious

109
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,768
Access example in civilised countries we drive on the left-hand side of the road

110
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,008
There's no particular reason for it I remember when Sweden was civilized until the 1960s

111
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:09,920
They had a national referendum where the people voted to stay civilised but the government have the sense to ignore the referendum

112
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:12,224
I'm talking about that example lot at the moment

113
00:06:12,992 --> 00:06:15,296
Yeah and I moved over to driving on the right

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,880
Is that a universal I mean

115
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,672
Yeah you don't drive on the left

116
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:24,256
In the bin Sweden if a child runs on the road in the UK

117
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:27,840
If a child runs on the road in front of you drive anywhere to avoid them

118
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,704
So there is still exceptions evening rigidly constrained systems

119
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,032
Are there if you have a work Friday that was a bit different I remember

120
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:41,664
Something moved on the road in front of me in the middle of a Welsh Mountain Road and I stand the brakes on if you do

121
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:48,320
Discovered it was a sheet that the car was a write off and I phoned up car admin and they said next time kill the sheep pants

122
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,112
Still slightly worried about that one

123
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,232
Yes, had an overdose she put kids in till much later but never mind

124
00:06:55,744 --> 00:07:00,864
I'm so basically and obviously mean we got it we can basically sense categorize respond

125
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:03,936
And we can apply best practice

126
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:05,984
Because there is one right way of doing things

127
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:12,128
Remember went to the complicated demand which is most engineering approaches set

128
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:15,712
That's actually where there is a relationship

129
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,016
Between cause and effect there is a right answer

130
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:22,880
Billy can only be discovered through analysis or by the deployment of the right type of expert

131
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:26,208
Get me can we do expertise as universal by the way

132
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:29,536
But at this point we can absolutely trust the expert decision

133
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,864
So basically at this point I sent

134
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,144
Amylose respond

135
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:37,728
And I apply good practice not best practice

136
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,056
Not going to argue at the moment

137
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:44,384
90% of systems architecture

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,200
90% of design sits in that domain

139
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,832
Busy assumption is there a right hand so we can discover it we can design for it that's it

140
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,392
I'll qualify that in a minute

141
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,488
We don't get if we over constrained system here

142
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:01,792
You get this catastrophic failure

143
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,328
Which is why chaos

144
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:05,888
Is a temporary space

145
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,192
And I get out of it by accident

146
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:08,960
Respond

147
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,240
The good news is

148
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:11,264
I get novelty

149
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,592
Is nothing like a crisis

150
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:16,384
To produce innovation

151
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,504
If I did a version is all about starvation pressure and perspective shift

152
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,272
If you look at it

153
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:26,880
Is when we can't use existing frameworks or existing ways of doing things

154
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:28,416
Then we get invented

155
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:32,256
Yeah that goes back to the cognitive entrainement patterns earlier

156
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:34,816
So basically you're saying that we get the complex to me

157
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:36,608
In the complex domain

158
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,960
What I actually do is

159
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:41,728
Probe

160
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:42,752
Sense respond

161
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,056
But I probe in parallel

162
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:46,080
Not in sync

163
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,872
That's really important

164
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,712
Because if I do one thing it will nearly always work

165
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,016
You know about the Hawthorne effect

166
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:57,856
Ok that that's

167
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:02,464
Cable manufacturers in New York State 1920 site of scientific management

168
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,560
Increase lighting levels and people became more productive that's good news

169
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:09,120
Pistes de with no publisher book

170
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:10,144
Cold Light

171
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,936
The secret to productivity

172
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:18,080
And have a certificate and training course based on how to switch on and off lights and change light bulbs

173
00:09:18,848 --> 00:09:23,200
Then they had some pretension to be real scientist so they lowered the lighting level

174
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
People became more productive

175
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,112
What they actually found his people respond to novelty

176
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,744
Anything done which is new with attention will work the first time

177
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,304
It doesn't mean it will scale or repeat

178
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:45,216
Can you get somebody terrible management books that way one of my least favourite at the moment is lean startup if anybody's read that

179
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:52,128
Guy goes interviews people who know who's been successful as a whole body problems there because the way you remember things have your say

180
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:52,896
Successful

181
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,712
Is different from the way you remember them if you fail

182
00:09:56,224 --> 00:10:01,088
And both of them are different from the way they actually happened for right so you can't just what people say

183
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,720
Another same time at the conference and did you study the companies who failed and he said no why would we do that

184
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:12,096
I said we did it when I was in IBM with Dorothy Leonard at Harvard Business School

185
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:14,656
We discovered all the companies have failed

186
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:18,496
Did exactly the same things as the companies who succeeded

187
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,312
Sjsu had a market

188
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,152
So a certain percentage would bound to succeed

189
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:32,320
And that's the trouble we got this very lightweight research throwing at simplistic recipes it's really dangerous

190
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,416
Here we go back to complexity I've tried Sainsbury's phone

191
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,744
And practice here will effectively be a merchant

192
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:41,792
I will always see a pattern

193
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:47,168
No important thing in the latest version I can have in call the liminal version

194
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,192
Looks like this

195
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:51,264
Secrets to liminal spaces

196
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:56,384
Illuminati is a really important concept in anthropology

197
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:59,968
And if you really want to understand humans go and do an answer

198
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:03,296
Topology course alright don't go on some cultural conversion course

199
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,600
Most anthropologists

200
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:08,416
No more about culture in the first year of studies

201
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:12,000
And cultural change consultants will now in their entire life Style

202
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,375
I basically liminality is a sense of transition if you put on a mask

203
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:24,287
Is a point where you start to become what the mask represents but there's a state of transition before you do it

204
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
Add a liminal concept in software design

205
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,199
Isobel actually not committing until you really have to

206
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,807
The longer you hold things in the state of transition the more options you've got

207
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,439
And actually in software development which is I know far better than architecture

208
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
This is actually where things like scrumpet

209
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,655
Because they are linear iterations based on a defined requirement with a degree of ambiguity

210
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Therefore we're going to explore it

211
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,055
That's the trouble we eliminate ambiguity too early on

212
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
Big V12 restricted set to do linear experiments

213
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
In a mixed methods approach

214
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,063
What we start to do is to say and I use development that same as I know that better

215
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Yeah there's nothing wrong with water for

216
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
Absolutely nothing wrong with Hardy structure processes you can use a togaf framework you can use rigid frameworks

217
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
You know exactly what you got to deliver you know the resource with an acceptable time friends why would you not take a waterfall approach

218
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,103
Am I working with telstra on this and telstra just gonna go

219
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
Therefore nobody got promoted unless they were Roger

220
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
So the waterfall guys rang one year sprint

221
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,903
So they could say they would really add you alright

222
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
That's what the thing is very very Common

223
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
Human beings a candy

224
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
You can't just the way the is language

225
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
I'm over here

226
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,959
One of the Big Things We Lost in architecture and I'll swear to concept

227
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
The time boxers

228
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
A2B got obsessed with two week time boxers

229
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,151
Certainly when I was involved in architect in last decision support systems

230
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
We will play around with three months

231
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,015
With a guaranteed delivery at the end of three months

232
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
But we very resource or weed very delivery

233
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
To meet the date

234
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:20,767
I actually gave us a lot of flexibility and definition phase and people looking like forgotten that stuff

235
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
Was it created the rights of the focus

236
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,215
Over here we're experimenting with radically different approaches and I'll just mention three of them

237
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
At this point

238
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,079
When is winter starting to look at an articulated needs

239
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
Before we even get

240
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
The design of any type

241
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
What we need to do is to surface the an articulated needs the things that people don't yet know they what they want

242
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
So when the ways we do that

243
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,535
Is we get people to interpret all of their technologies into Watts

244
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
Call obstruction metadata

245
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,471
We capture continuous narratives from users about day today for stations about their work

246
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
And then we merge the two databases together

247
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Can we look at clusters

248
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Abuser anecdotes with technology

249
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
Inside one of those come together

250
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
And that gives us novel ideas

251
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
He actually did this with Philips lighting

252
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,439
Yeah taking all of the technology capability customer stories

253
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
Putting the two together

254
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
Five clusters three of which became multi million dollar businesses

255
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,935
Is what you're doing is you're forcing accepted moments or insights

256
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,543
By moving up to a level of abstraction remember I started this on language

257
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
Ok if you don't know it we learn to paint

258
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Before we learn to speak

259
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Is a species

260
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
Art comes before language in human evolution

261
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,951
And it turns out that has major evolution invented you was an accident when it happened

262
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,279
Somebody sketch some pictures on a wall it can like work for the hunt

263
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
But then it started to really work

264
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
But if you move up a level of abstraction

265
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
You make connections in completely novel works

266
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
Engineers

267
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Actually I musicians

268
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,895
Will tell you they have their best problem solving capability

269
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
When they play music

270
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
Art is critical to human invention

271
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
It's where the problem is Stem education is really scary

272
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
Because we reducing human beings down to the level of Aon

273
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,303
Hannah Stephanie doing this is about to start with University of California San Diego

274
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
And this is actually much more about infrastructure management

275
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,935
If you come to the university to do computing

276
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,799
You have to phone 0300 with somebody from the humanities and somebody from the pure sciences

277
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,615
When you're given pass by the University of Leeds 3 months

278
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,759
What we're doing is building across silent network of people who focus on a task

279
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,343
So that we can bring things together in novel unexpected ways

280
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,975
And a lot of this is about creating an architecture for Discovery

281
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,047
Raven trading architectures deliver

282
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
What people have asked for

283
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
Did you get the discovery architecture right

284
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
The recipe comes a lot easier

285
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
Because you got actually more structure in terms of the way you work

286
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,895
I could go on and that but there's a lot more material that was I can move onto

287
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
Keeping I want to finish office it's question and modelling

288
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,295
Are you a fine people in complexity Theory

289
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,623
This is what I call the computational complexity guys

290
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
My field is cool down through complexity

291
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
And the study of complexity in human system

292
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
The computational guys think everything is like blocking

293
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,655
Anyway but it's block around in sky schoolboys algorithm

294
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,471
It's follow the next bird max speed avoid collision

295
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,287
At that also works by the way if you want

296
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,079
To drive south of Naples in Italy

297
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,711
It's a much more effective heuristic than following the rules alright if you max speed avoid collision

298
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:58,367
Yeah and follow the next car you actually have a stressful driving experience even in Sorrento if you assume they follow the rules

299
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Oh forget it alright

300
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
That's not the way it works

301
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
It will be in that human beings on hands

302
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,047
Because we haven't got see how you can predict

303
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
The entire complexity of the termites nest

304
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:14,495
Visit genetically encoded rules responding consistently to phone them stimulation

305
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,079
The human beings can see things through metaphors

306
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
We see things for abstraction

307
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,527
We can change identity overnight when I'm with my children I'm a completely different person than on stage

308
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,415
We don't have single agency we don't have single rules with complex pattern based creatures

309
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
So basically human beings on time

310
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
And that means you got a real problem with modelling

311
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
I gave the keynote of the European complexity conference all academics this Edward I speak about why you can't model of Complex Adaptive

312
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:51,103
I said no problem nobody told me the entire audience will be academics who built models

313
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,759
Yeah that would like Daniel going into the lines then that was when I met girl man he was the other here

314
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,831
And you can't challenge get on my knees when the world's most famous physicist

315
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,159
He backed me up and said you can't model the human system

316
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,767
The only valid model of human system is a system itself

317
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,143
A map to some extent is where we're starting to go but it's also part of the general concern

318
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
About an increase of artificial turf

319
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Official intelligence

320
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,383
This is actually real problems anybody hasn't ready in M Banks books surface detail

321
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:29,503
I am back is a brilliant science fiction writer tragically died of cancer

322
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:35,391
Are you then propose to his long-term girlfriend by asking her if she would do the honour of becoming his widow

323
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
Is that sort of sense of humour alright

324
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,095
Read that and be terrified I've just been involved in a big think tank in California

325
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,679
General Hughes actor is actually as second most

326
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
Highest existential threat

327
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
The humanity after nuclear war

328
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
And ecological

329
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
Change is actually number for

330
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:00,735
When the reasons is with reducing human beings to information retrieval and process

331
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
Nai is better at that

332
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,879
And we won't go onto 101 machines and things like that

333
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,463
We need to be very careful about that because a human being is more than this

334
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,279
And then of course we get all the culture nonsense

335
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
Everybody wants to engineer if in doubt blame culture

336
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,471
If your pet project didn't work it was their fault

337
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,567
Because they have the wrong culture or the wrong mindset and this is

338
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
Appalling science

339
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
There is no such thing as a mindset

340
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,527
Is a complex set of interactions overtimes in a series of

341
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
The tropes

342
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
But it's not an individual mindset

343
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,463
You get people who will gather people stories that's good news we gather people stories

344
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
But we let

345
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
People interpret than themselves

346
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,399
We don't interpret them or let computers interpret them

347
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,703
Because that restricts us to text

348
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
And by the way you can write down

349
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
10% of what you know

350
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,919
Anything which is processing text

351
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,503
Is again dealing with a very very limited set

352
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
There's a power issue here as well

353
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,391
Who interprets people's narrative is there

354
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
This is from work with just doing with the BBC

355
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
Weather presenting cartoons

356
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,583
Employees are choosing cartoons which represent their culture

357
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,679
Interpreting those on the high abstraction metadata

358
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,007
I'm from that with an actually drawing a series of maps

359
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
How many reasons does we don't want to fall into one of these traps

360
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,943
Yep mansplaining postcolonialism

361
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,783
All that lovely one about the expert must be right

362
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Ok

363
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
I'm giving you three illustration as there

364
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
If you really want to understand the human system

365
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,743
You got a hand over the power of interpretation

366
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
To the people themselves

367
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
Does it mean you don't have a room for experts

368
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,679
We got to distribute the property function you can't tell that centrally

369
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,471
Save from net

370
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
That allows us to do some very interest

371
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
This example is a dispositional map

372
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,943
And this is actually where we are starting to go with systems architecture

373
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Bolsover things like kanban

374
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
So if you look at categories and kanban

375
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,647
Ok the key Concepts and kanban is working progress

376
00:21:16,671 --> 00:21:22,815
Yeah not the representation of those who hear the advocaat she would think it was all about Post-it notes moving between columns

377
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,119
Key Concepts is working progress

378
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:29,727
In an audit system work in progress is a series of discrete job unit

379
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,007
The kanban Works

380
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:35,103
In a complex system is a series of unrealised

381
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,127
Potentialities

382
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,431
So the representation has to change

383
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:45,087
This is actually a landscape drawing from mass observation self interpretation of the point of origin

384
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,695
Anything actually cultural change map so if I actually want to change culture on this one

385
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:52,511
If my desires Stacey's appear

386
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,351
You can see I've got some things up there sexy

387
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,119
What's a tick in the box

388
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:59,167
This is very very negative

389
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,727
To move them up there is a Step Too Far

390
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:05,311
What I do instead is I look at this

391
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,615
And I say what can I do tomorrow

392
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,407
To create more like these

393
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:10,943
If you would like those

394
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:15,551
What I'm doing this is a key principle of complex design

395
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:18,879
Is an shift in the system to an adjacent possible

396
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,463
And once I get enough stability at that point

397
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,511
I can use more conventional approaches

398
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:28,863
This is what I'm talking about about architect into under the discovery

399
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,911
Before you architect for delivery

400
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,495
Did you actually start with the start with delivery

401
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,543
You miss the discovery phase

402
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,847
Are you going to miss opportunities as well as threats

403
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,663
That's actually from a hospital

404
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:45,247
Autolyse answer key Concepts call fractal engagement

405
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:51,135
So the same data can produce frameworks at the level of responsibility of every individual

406
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,743
And again I haven't got time to go into this I'll go to this in the strategy session

407
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:59,327
Fractal engagement is the way we actually achieve change

408
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:03,167
People don't make decisions about what other people should do

409
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:08,031
They make decisions about what they can do tomorrow within their own sphere of competence

410
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:12,127
Then the system as a whole torrent extra multiple actions

411
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:14,943
That's a big concept by just hinting at it now

412
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,503
And I thought we call fractal change

413
00:23:18,015 --> 00:23:18,527
EBay

414
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:20,831
It's all about multiple perspectives

415
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:26,207
This is actually from again this is work on the whole variety.

416
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:27,743
This is Peace and Conflict resolution

417
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:33,887
What we doing here is present in an infographic and when are doing this in system design Discovery architecture

418
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:37,471
Representing infographics about where we think we should be

419
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,799
We're getting every employee to interpret that

420
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:45,663
Enjoying the max of the interpretation before anybody talks to anybody else

421
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:50,271
In that space is actually from Columbia this is

422
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:51,551
Yeah big one

423
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:57,183
You can see that blue and green see the same data in such radically different ways

424
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:59,999
Sitting down to talk to each other is a waste of time

425
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,583
The only thing they both agree on his they hate the red guys

426
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,655
Get the strategy here

427
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:09,983
Is there actually make these more extreme

428
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,823
Will it be getting new consensus in the middle

429
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:19,199
The other reason we do this is I want to find outliers

430
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,759
Agama talk about Discovery architecture

431
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:27,135
I want to see groups of people were seeing the world differently from everybody else

432
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:30,207
Because those are the things the 17%

433
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:32,511
Who seen the Cancer nodule

434
00:24:33,023 --> 00:24:37,375
Rob and people were going with orthodoxy so again that's the concept of Discovery architecture

435
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:38,911
RAM delivery architect

436
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:43,263
And the final slide finish off on this How You scale a complex system

437
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:49,663
Again this is a big field but the one thing you don't do is you never scale the complex adaptor

438
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,431
The system

439
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:52,991
By aggregation or imitation

440
00:24:54,783 --> 00:24:58,111
You don't take everything and aggregated up into some massive diagram

441
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,927
And you don't say that worked will do more of it

442
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:08,607
What do you actually doing to decompose things and there's a whole body working on this by the way an object orientation

443
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:10,399
Remember to going back to at the moment

444
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,239
You decompose things to the lowest coherent object

445
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,823
You define protocols for the interactions be

446
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:18,847
Between the objects

447
00:25:19,615 --> 00:25:22,687
Annual animal patterns to emergency stimulator system

448
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:28,063
So you staying but scale by decomposition and recombination

449
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,367
Not by aggregation

450
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,415
And not bite imitation

451
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:36,511
Have a challenge for design the Challenge for architecture

452
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,327
Is the move much further back in the cycle

453
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:42,143
Video with an articulated knees

454
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,215
To discover on an objective basis

455
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:48,287
Novel possibilities unexpected consequences

456
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,615
Andy bell systems with the responsive capability

457
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:54,943
To exploit opportunities as they present themselves

458
00:25:55,455 --> 00:25:56,479
Before they're fully now

459
00:25:57,503 --> 00:26:01,599
In order to do that we need to have a sound understanding of the science

460
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:03,391
Behind human cognition

461
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,695
And the science behind system

462
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:09,279
Is under conditions of extreme uncertainty

463
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:13,375
Falling back for the constraints of natural science gives us security

464
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:17,983
Falling back to empirical past memories of what work before

465
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,543
Makes it very very random

466
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:22,079
Thank you very much for your time
