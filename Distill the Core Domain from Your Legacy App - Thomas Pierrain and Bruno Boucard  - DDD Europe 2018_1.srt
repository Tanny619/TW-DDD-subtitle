Knitting back

126
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,503

127
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Absolute

128
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575

Citroen mobility

130
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,559
Basically we have a problem in this is really loud I hear today is it

131
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,935
Podcast after calls because they trace recruit spinners

132
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,311
Excess of opportunities by the National Trust

133

00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
Every call

135
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,759
You made on Lozells back-end duper she's so that means that stuff to talk or Stockton

136
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:55,647
Every time you call one of those web API is child from

137
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Thought they were expecting

138
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
To do so badly

139
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Think they are being too much

140
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
So they asked us to have a look at the code

141
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Everything

142
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,447
What measures reasoning and continuous troubleshooting and fix

143
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
If you have something to fix

144
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,407
But not touching any record if you are Bruno and NI what would you recommend

00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Risotto

159
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
Because I apply the rule

160
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:28,831
So 7577 sitting exactly

161
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111

270
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Also if

271
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,983

273
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
In winter heights to find some available seats

274

00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
In cold get booking a house

288
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007

In Australia

346
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
We are not allowed to wear off

347
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Including it

348
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Because

349
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,463
Since we don't have any tennis courts near

350
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,559
New Year cottages for large two finger burger would be true to make it

Menu for that it's been

353
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
There's so much crap in things like that

354
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
So let's clean

355
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
Ruskin College

359
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,527
Is the first phases when you discover a cold

360
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,367
Because you need to be more coffee than before

361
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,208
To apply idp factoring

362
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,280
It's a way to discover 6

363
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,840
A little Wing

364
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
Name of the viable spies on tour

365
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
And after

366
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
Get into the proper way to improve our mental model

367
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
Between you don't come back from the beginning

368
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
Train to improve a little bit

369
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Yeah but before that

370
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,024
1st April on 63

371
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
But you noticed something wrong with you.

372
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
It's rather

373
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
Is difficult to

374
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,568
The coffee that is like cold or is right because it's another

375
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
A mistake

376
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,176
I don't see the mistake I prefer things to see Green

377
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Might also

378
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
You do that

379
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,600
Will it completely in your that tested it in the bag

380
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
It's a good technique

381
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
If you're in the same situation when this feeling

382
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,304
You need to recycle just before hitting the bag

383
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,400
You know that's destiny searching the baby

384
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
So that it's green you have a test harness to a factor and then you enable back

385
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
So

386
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
This is what

387
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
You're doing a white

388
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:46,784
Invoice meaning

389
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Create

390
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Current behavior

391
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
When your refactoring

392
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
Maintaining the current behaviour

393
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,568
So by creating a new test

394
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Tesco current behaviour

395
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,552
Yes I like a lot which is a golden master

396
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
Columbus oh to take a legacy code

397
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136

398
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,232
Nuro to write acceptance test

399
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
Every time I send that important to the Legacy code and the newest ostriches I will walk

400
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Rockingham

401
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,216
I must I'm expecting to see the same output

402
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
On both instances

403
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
So that result

404
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
Even understanding Gillingham

405
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
I can't have just done this

406
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:50,528
Making me and forcing me do I don't break any existing video

407
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
Thought this is a strategy that we could have done better here we are watching TV

408
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Beautiful as an unexpected

409
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:05,632
So we stick to that event for an agency

410
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,704

In the back of the room can you see all the code

423
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104
I realise that this is running in real time I know I'm not breaking the computer

424
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
