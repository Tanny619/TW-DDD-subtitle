1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Are you ready? Yeah? Okay, here we go.

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:12,800
First question for you, who experienced some difficulties

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,616
to grasp DDD concept at the very beginning

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,944
while it's the time to put it into your project or into your code?

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
Yeah ok. So you're not alone. I have to confess

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
I see a lot of talk about DDD.

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
And I

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,000
tried to apply on legacy code.

9
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,536
So that's why we've made this session.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
Absolutely. At this time here we will mostly talk about technical patterns.

11
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:50,176
And most likely talking about where and how to put your domain experience of your business

12
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
into your code.

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,272
Much more than strategical pattern. We'll talk a little bit about it.

14
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58,112
But it's rather technical.

15
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
on the entire session.

16
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's introduce ourself maybe before we move?

17
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
Oh yeah. So I'm Bruno Boucard. I'm coming from Paris and I'm a coach.

18
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,080
I'm teaching TDD, BDD and DDD.

19
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
And I'm in charge of

20
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
BDD meet up in Paris.

21
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,784
Ok, my name is Thomas Pierrain.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
I'm working software since 18 years. I'm also co-organize the DDD Paris meetup.

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
I'm kind of opposite, by use cases and

24
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
problems based.

25
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
Cause I think we jump too much too soon into the solution based.

26
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
All our ? and stuff like that, all solutions.

27
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
So this is one of my obsession.

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,056
Ok we have some gifts

29
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
for you.

30
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
So we have two books.

31
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
The blue one and the Refactoring by Martin Fowler.

32
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,904
So to win those books you would have to tweet as hell during the session.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
Using the #DDDEU.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
We have a referee here

35
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,216
So he will have a look at that hash tag. And the most

36
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
funny tweet or you can record, you can take picture, you can do jokes about us or about you, whatever

37
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,480
and John will tell us the two winners at the end of the session. All right? Cool.

38
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,344
Our domain for today will be train.

39
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
Train is kind of large. Actually so we will focus more on the seat reservation optimazation.

40
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
Here is the model of a train. The train which has three coaches. Coach A, coach B, and coach C.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Which has some

42
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,312
seats already reserved in the orange.

43
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
Empty seats are in white.

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
And here we are asking 6 seats

45
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,832
to be reserved there in the train in blue. This is a simple model but that may help to understand something.

46
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
something. Okay?

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,720
We have two business rules for today for the system. The first one is

48
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,584
We should not reserve more than 70% of the entire train capacity.

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
Okay this is the first business rule.The second business rule is

50
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,032
When I want to reserve, I want all my seats in the same coach.

51
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,848
We don't want to split families and friends

52
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,920
between coaches. Right?

53
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Simple.

54
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,784
We are taking those rules from Emily Bache's Train Reservation.

55
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,392
And we've put some crappy code on top of that but... ok

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Our domain expert couldn't manage to be with us in Amsterdam today but we talked a lot with him before

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
previous weeks.

58
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,632
So he talked a lot about rain

59
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,984
He talked about train ID or identifier. He talked about seats.

60
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
Coaches.

61
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
Reservation attempts and whether or not these reservation attemps are fulfilled.

62
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,784
And you know there are also to book. If I'm to book,

63
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
Booking reference we have explained what it is.

64
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,672
Reservation, reservation failure.

65
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:19,327
That's the word from the expert. Yeah you know the session we have, those words

66
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
kind of

67
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
So we will work for a start-up company which name is Train Train. They provide

68
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,127
seat reservation service which is basically web API.

69
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,479
And this web API to do its work, he has to rely on the

70
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
external backends provided by external companies

71
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
So in fact it's SNCF

72
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,927
So the first backends provided by SNCF,

73
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
which is extermal to our company, it's Train Data

74
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
Basically it's a

75
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
train topology service.

76
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,143
Meaning we provide a train event for you.

77
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
And we get back the topology of the train meaning

78
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
all the coaches and for every coach, all the seats and for every seat, whether or not it's available

79
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
or already reserved.

80
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Okay. Quantity

81
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
Second one is the booking reference. This is a kind of tricky one because... not tricky

82
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
When you buy a ticket, you have an ID

83
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
on your train ticket. This is the idea actually. Yeah. But this is a service that only provide a unique identifier.

84
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
We call it

85
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,583
book anything with that.

86
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,423
All we can do is to get a unique identifier

87
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
to play with.

88
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
And once seat reservation service on the left will have train topology, find available seats,

89
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
then,

90
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,199
Getting a booking reference, we actually book

91
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
the reservation

92
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,039
through the national train operator service

93
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
through the last train booking service.

94
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
All right? In terms of we are kind of down streams. We are a tiny start-up in that

95
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:58,655
open market that hasn't been opened recently. So these are the back-end provided by the national train.

96
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
Is it ok for all of you?

97
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
We will continue.

98
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,615
Maybe Bruno we can do a demo of the web API

99
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
It will take a few

100
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
seconds to

101
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
switch.

102
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
So

103
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
I use postman

104
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:27,231
where you can see the url to call the web API.

105
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
And we can see the body

106
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,471
The payload is with two fields.

107
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,031
Train_id is the identifier of the train.

108
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,359
And the number_of_seats requested.

109
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Ok

110
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
So if you post.

111
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Yeah.

112
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
Take a while.

113
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,695
Still loading. Okay and we have a answer.

114
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
The answer.

115
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
The first is the train_id.

116
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Okay?

117
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Second one is a booking reference.

118
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
Allocated by service as I said before.

119
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
And the list of seats

120
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:11,031
We get back.

121
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,503
Okay. So basically that's quite simple way to interact with our system. Yeah.

122
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,559
Okay. And basically we have a problem. And this is reason why we are here today.

123
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,935
Train Train start-up, called us because they face recurrent penalties,

124
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,311
Excess of penalties by the national train service.

125
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
Why?

126
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
Every call

127
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,759
You made on all those back-ends, you pay fees. So that means that start-up the Train Train start-up.

128
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:55,647
Every time you call one of those web API is charged from these.

129
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
So they are expected

130
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
to do so. But,

131
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
they think they are paying too much.

132
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
So they asked us to have a look at the code.

133
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
And to see

134
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,447
what may be the reason and can we troubleshoot and fix

135
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
if we have something to fix

136
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,407
Okay? But before touching any legacy code, if you are... Bruno and I, what would you recommend

137
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
us to do?

138
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
(Test?) Test, yes absolutely.

139
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,439
In fact, this is the reason why we miss the keynote. We have a bit test on this this morning.

140
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,023
Discovering the code in trying to highlight

141
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,655
all those business rules. So we've made so far 3 exception tests.

142
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,543
First on is a happy pass. We have a train with only one coach

143
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,151
with 10 seats. And we want allocate or reserve 3 seats.

144
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,991
And as you can see that's exactly what I do with postman. And exactly the same answer.

145
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
Simple happy pass. Ok.

146
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
Second one is the

147
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,351
Yeah this is the first business rule.  We can't exceed 70%,

148
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
for reservation , in all the train. And if we ask 2 seats,

149
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
and you can see I already have 6 seats reserved,

150
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Here.

151
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
Because I applied the rule,

152
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:28,831
So 70% is 7 seats in the train you can sit. Exactly. So the way to repond an error

153
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
is this one

154
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
I get the train ID but the booking reference is empty.

155
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
And the list of seats are empty.

156
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
This is how Train Train is telling us, no

157
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
reservation has been made for you.

158
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Ok.

159
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,031
And the third test was... test highlighting the all seats must be in the same coach please.

160
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
The second business rule.

161
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,663
And in that case we found a bug. We found a bug because we asked

162
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
here we have a train with two coaches. And one is almost full.

163
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
The other is completely free. And when we asked 2 seats,

164
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,279
Actually we get here. One seat in coach A and one seat in coach B, which was unexpected because

165
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
we don't want to split families and friends.

166
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
So we're thinking about that. Bruno was saying that

167
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,239
it may explain something related to this phase.

168
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
You have some ideas about what may explain the extra phase.

169
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Imagine you use

170
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
the website.

171
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
You call the service.

172
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
And you prepare a trip

173
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
With your family or your

174
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
girlfriend boyfriend.

175
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:40,183
What happened? （Maybe you want to cancel your reservation because you cannot sit with your firend.)

176
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,375
Yeah. Exactly. The answer is to cancel.

177
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:52,263
Because I'm not pleased to have 2 seats in 2 different coaches. We cancel maybe retry it.

178
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:57,663
Cancel retry, cancel retry, at the end of the day I will switch to another provider.

179
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
I will left Train Train.

180
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
Poor experience.

181
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,087
But it may explain that because every time every attempt will be charged actually.

182
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,671
So that was our hypothesis.

183
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,511
And we discussed it with domain expert and he said, yeah,

184
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,351
maybe a new answer, please

185
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
guys can you please fix that bug.

186
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:23,519
So we are here to fix that bug all together. And we will ask you to help us in the journey.

187
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
So what would you recommend to fix that bug?
大家现在有什么建议吗？

188
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:40,639
What would be your strategy?

189
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,327
We are the train reservation service on the left on the Orange. Here, let me...ok

190
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,703
We are only working on that seat reservation in the yellow.

191
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:59,055
These are dependencies. We don't have leverage on that actually. (Are you the only cosumer for these)

192
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
No we compete with other companies. We are start-up and we compete with other companies.

193
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:11,391
We need some information from those two and we need to set and to comfirm

194
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
and to book

195
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
to make transaction with that guy

196
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
So

197
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
That's kind of interaction we have.

198
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,143
So it's time for the strategy what would you recommend? (Writing tests?)

199
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Write tests.

200
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Yeah write tests.

201
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,615
So actually we already wrote 2 tests so that highlight the bug. So we will have to fix that test. Ok?

202
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
So let's dive into the code.

203
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Bruno has

204
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
set breakpoints

205
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
We can call it here. Yeah absolutely. Just a minute.

206
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
It's launching the bug

207
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
So here if you

208
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,071
just slide to the left side of the screen

209
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:56,447
It's a C# code. It's a asp.net code API.

210
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,847
It's simple for those who are doing java spring boot. It's simple for... When we request that post on networks

211
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
with that name

212
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,455
We get that call back

213
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,575
And it's a ReservationRequestDto we receive.

214
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:18,975
Just to have a look at the Dto. It's very simple, exactly the payload of the json.

215
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Absolutely.

216
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,703
And so after all that, we installed that, if you can slide to the left, thank you. So we installed that

217
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,567
webTicketManager which it seems to be the entry point of the system and we call reserve

218
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
method on it,

219
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
providing train id and the number of seat requested.

220
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Ok so

221
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,063
This is what we have test so far

222
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,135
If we have a look at the tests. These are failing.

223
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
We have 3 tests.

224
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
It's like kind of exception tests. We consider these items as black bugs.

225
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,167
And we sent some requests and we checked the

226
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
json.

227
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
The last one is the test

228
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
demonstrate the problem. Ok?

229
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
So wait. We have a tool, it's name is ?  We see every time we change

230
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
something, we type something, we change the code. It will run the test in background, execute it,

231
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
and provide us a feedback loop with a colored arrow on the margin.

232
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
So green is fine and red is

233
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,399
there's a problem. And there's an arrow in Red.

234
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Bruno, if you...

235
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
Yeah I will show. Have another view of the error.

236
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,103
Basically it's the problem. We are expecting to have

237
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
2 seats in 1B and 2B. And actually we get

238
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,295
10A and 1B. So this is the bug we discuss earlier.

239
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
Ok everyone?

240
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
I think it would be a good thing to stop to have another view of what the Reserve method is doing.

241
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,119
I'll just align the code for you.

242
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,519
Let's have a first overview. We discovered that this morning so we will have

243
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:12,383
a little bit more knowledge about it. So I will try to help you to

244
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
to have an overview.

245
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
First we ? a list of available seats. That should be

246
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
probably the result of the method.

247
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
Then we call a get train on a trainDataService.

248
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,351
And we get something like we call jsonTrain. Maybe is a json topology we will see it after.

249
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,751
Then we install a train. A train installs of ? json topology.

250
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,895
And after that train installed, we do some business rules here and there. So here,

251
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
if the number of seat already reserved in the train plus the number of seats I'm requesting

252
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
is below,

253
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
is below something like GetMaxRes, let me check.

254
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,511
Should be some percentage or something like that. Yeah, 70%.

255
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Ok.

256
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,815
70% of the overall train capacity.

257
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
So if

258
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,983
I respect the first business rule, I continue.

259
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:15,871
I continue. The numberOfReserv seems to be an accumulator variable here

260
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
And we tried to find some available seats.

261
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,575
An availble seat in that system is the one that the BookingRef is empty.

262
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,951
We have a property and if it's empty string,

263
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
that means that seat is available

264
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
And then we can add it

265
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
into the list.

266
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,887
The list that we will return at the end of the method

267
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
Is it okay for you so for?

268
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,079
Then we have a kind of stupid forEach. We haven't seen that in years ago.

269
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,175
Oh then what do we have yes if we can't

270
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,063
find the number of seat requested, what do we do? We get the answer, you know,

271
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,135
the result that is saying that you can't even reserve.

272
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
Remember, it's a failing message.

273
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:09,887
If it work, that when we call the bookingReferenceService, the one in the middle on the right side.

274
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
And call GetBookingReference.

275
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
Then we

276
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,615
assign a booking reference to every one of the available seat that we have found.

277
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
So far

278
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,967
We have a bunch of accumulators here.

279
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
And then, again, it's

280
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
pretty much the same if. If you look at...Yeah it seems similar. No the first one is negative.

281
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
Not really same. But,

282
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:40,351
if it's still ok, oh we use the cache? Yeah. Interesting.

283
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
We will see that...why, okay?

284
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
And then what do we... Actually this is the one that is making the booking, you know.

285
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Transaction actually.

286
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,175
It will be the external web API we call to book a seat.

287
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
If I

288
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
enter that,

289
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
let me check,

290
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
here the implemetation.

291
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,231
Yeah basically we call a web API.

292
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,399
Real Interesting.

293
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,375
And it seems that if we don't have any kind of exception here,

294
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
what do we do? We return the answer.

295
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
And the answer is the one dumping the list of seats

296
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,127
we have found so far. Okay?

297
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
And the case here, what was it? Yes, in the case of the train capacity limit

298
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,343
has been exceeded,

299
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,719
we return the empty... you can't reserve anything in that train. It's a failure.

300
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Ok for everyone of you?

301
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
We will make a few review working on it. But,

302
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
do you have some

303
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,703
feedback about that so far？

304
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,971
(Why are you using string concatenation to create json?)

305
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,919
Why are we using string concatenation to create json?

306
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
Actually this is not our code.

307
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:06,879
As a declarer. This is a customer we discover this morning. So yes, but this is a good remark, why do we

308
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,839
append a json here in the middle of something that, it's expected to be some kind of

309
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
business logic.

310
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:26,079
(Prove it with a github link.) We don't even use git in that project. You know.

311
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:34,151
So I can't do that. (Maybe I think the business logic is quite intermixed all togather in one function?)

312
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,807
Yeah, you are right.

313
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
Yeah absolutely. Yeah.

314
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:44,255
That is a strategy we will try to apply with you. We try to discover

315
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,327
the domain concept through this code.

316
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:55,775
And we try to figure out how can we improve that because so far there's something that's really bother me.

317
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,347
We were talking about the domain expert

318
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
talking with us with tons of concepts.

319
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,783
Can you see apart the train, and the

320
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,367
concept of seat, do you see any

321
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,991
other concept as well?

322
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,463
There's something missing. (Coach isn't explained. )

323
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,839
Yeah. The concept of coach is completely missing here.

324
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,631
And other stuff? (Reservation?)

325
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,775
Reservation, absolutely. No reservation. No reservation at time so far.

326
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,591
So, who have experienced code like this?

327
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
In this case. Some of you.

328
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
So we are not alone. So the idea here, for us will be to have a kind of way of

329
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
improving it.

330
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Because,

331
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,463
since we don't have any kind of coach here,

332
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:52,559
the strategy for us to fix the bug would be to make it

333
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
But before that,

334
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
there's so much crappy thing and like that.

335
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
So let's clean,

336
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
first clean the deck? Yeah.

337
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,103
Do you know the name clean the deck?

338
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
The expression clean the deck? No?

339
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
Clean the deck

340
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,527
is the first phase when you discover a code,

341
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,367
because you need to be more confident before

342
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,208
to apply deep refactoring.

343
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:23,280
It's a way to discover, fix a little

344
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
names of the variables, for example,

345
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
And after,

346
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
get into the program. Yeah, it's a way to prepare our mental model in your head.

347
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:40,736
So come back from the beginning, so clean the deck, you will have another view,

348
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
trying to improve a little bit.

349
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
but before that.

350
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,024
(You have typo in 63.) We have typo in 63? Yeah yeah, it's for sure, for sure. It's really a legacy code.

351
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
But you notice something wrong? We'll fix that.

352
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
It's red.

353
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
It's difficult to

354
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,568
be confident if my code is red because if I made

355
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
a mistake,

356
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,176
I don't see the mistake. I prefer to see green

357
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
in my tool. So

358
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
to do that,

359
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,600
we'll completely ignore the test and just search the bug.

360
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
It's a good technique

361
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
if you're in the same situation when the test is failing,

362
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,304
and you need to refactor just before fixing the bug

363
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,400
you ignore that test and just search the bug.

364
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
So that it's green you have a test on this. You refactor and then you enable back the test to fix the bug.

365
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,080
So this is what

366
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
you're doing. And white

367
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:50,784
is meaning we don't run the test. And now I'm ready. (Fast question. Does it look better to

368
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
create a test, which test the

369
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
current behavior,

370
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
because when your refactoring, you want to basically

371
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
maintain the current behaviour.) Yeah.

372
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,568
(So by creating a new test, so that ignore the old test.) Absolutely. (By creating a new test which test the

373
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
current behaviour, you can't basically break it.)

374
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,552
Yeah. That is a technique I like a lot which is a golden master.

375
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
Golden master is you take a legacy code,

376
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136
you clone it,

377
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,232
and you write acceptance tests.

378
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:34,632
Every time I send that input into the legacy code and the new instance, which is the one I will work on,

379
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,216
I'm expecting to see the same output

380
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
on both instances.

381
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
So that without

382
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
even understanding the legacy,

383
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
I can have a test on this.

384
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:50,528
Making me and forcing me... I don't break any existing behavior.

385
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
So this is a strategy that we could have done. But here we are implementing the business rule

386
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
as a domain expertise.

387
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:05,632
So we will stick to that point for now. But it's a good way for refactor.

388
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,704
Just clean the deck Bruno.

389
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,752
The first variable,

390
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,056
this is as noticeable, the variable seat.

391
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,444
I'll just have a look

392
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,808
where is used. Far from the usage. Yeah, far.

393
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
So

394
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
maybe,

395
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,768
I can decide to move this one

396
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,328
close to the usage.

397
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
Here for example. In the back of the room can you see all the code?

398
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104
Because my test is running in real time I know I'm not breaking the code. It's still green.

399
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
The behavior of the C programmer, because I was a C programmer, was to put

400
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,112
all the variable at the beginning of the code.

401
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
So this is your...?

402
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,304
No it's not mine. Ok, second one is count.

403
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
Count, so... What a name.

404
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
Yeah, count, wow.

405
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:17,568
What a stupid loop. Yeah, we're looping on the list.

406
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,872
Actually it's a list of property count.

407
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,432
It's exactly the same number.

408
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,832
We have a hint here. It's unused. Maybe ? developer want to say something?

409
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:34,208
So what I can do is maybe to use

410
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
availabelSeats.

411
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
And apply count property.

412
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,864
Yeah because at the end of the for each loop, count will have the same

413
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
value as availableSeats. I can remove this one.

414
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Okay?

415
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,240
Cool, I'll leave it.

416
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,848
On this screen hight, do we have ah...before we...We can check.

417
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
One, two.

418
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Two

419
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
Two and a half? Two and a half, yeah.

420
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:00,576
So that was another thing that bother me to have a method like that.

421
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
Ok.

422
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:10,536
Ok, this is a code for the train topology.

423
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,352
Maybe we can rename it?

424
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
Yeah. Ok?

425
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Train topology?

426
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
Yeah that' fine.

427
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:23,616
Traintopol and you can...Topology is better. That may explain we were talking about

428
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
the  train topology. So that's better. Okay, trainInst.

429
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
Instruction? Instance?

430
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:37,952
We asked domain expert about that, he said no I'm not aware of train instance by domain. So,

431
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:44,352
should be train install maybe or. So let's treat its name into train. Yeah. So you install a train from a trainTopology ok? Yeah.

432
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,192
What is this guy?

433
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,032
numberOfReserv. Maybe you can just...

434
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:57,152
Put it here for people in the back to see everything. Ok. You see this one?

435
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,272
numberOfReserv. Is it used? Yeah.

436
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
It's a pattern actually.

437
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:09,696
We use a variable

438
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:16,096
for nothing and... Just in case the calculation, that count is wrong maybe you can have a...

439
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,936
Maybe that's intends? I don't know.

440
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,776
Some times we don't have to try to understand. This is just silly stuff.

441
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,408
Ok, so I can remove this one.

442
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,480
Ok so you get rid of it. Yeah I get rid of this one.

443
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Ok you can delete it.

444
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Yeah.

445
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,976
Maybe...Each is？ Each...

446
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,840
It's seat. Yes, from collection of Seats, we get a seat.

447
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,216
This is a typo. reservedSet.

448
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,872
We don't talk about set. We've asked the domain expert also, do we even have set? They said no. This is a loop too.

449
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
But never used.

450
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
Who has already seen that kind of

451
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:13,696
variables, declarations in the code not even used anymore

452
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
Yeah. Legacy code is full of

453
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,280
this kind of stuff.

454
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:21,376
And it's kind of polluting our mind.

455
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
This one.

456
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
Have a look at this one. We have

457
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,896
a if here. And we have pretty much the same if at the invest?

458
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
Yeah I'll just...

459
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:44,600
We like symmetry it's much better to compare stuff. To do so, as we suggested, to invest? Yeah, it's a good a idea.

460
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
Indent, invest if, and then,

461
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,304
ok we can see pretty much the same...

462
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,632
I will select...No, no, wait.

463
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
Just illustrate it.

464
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752
Here, as you can see there is one if. Here.

465
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
And pretty much the same here.

466
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,224
So the idea is since there is nothing in the middle we can cut the code into the if below.

467
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
And put it into the end of the first if.

468
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,880
This one, just at the end, to respect the algorithm.

469
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
So

470
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,560
it will simplify a little bit the code structure also.

471
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,912
It's really great. Green yeah. Okay?

472
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
So now you can...Read

473
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
Why are you doing that? Because... It's white. Yeah. Entrnce?, when the code

474
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
is not covered,

475
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
put a white

476
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
indicator.

477
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
It's a

478
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,600
good for us. This one is not necessary too.

479
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
Ok, you can remove some lines.

480
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,256
So I think we...

481
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,144
have some space? Yeah maybe this one can be closer to the usage.

482
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Ok.

483
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Ok so you

484
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,848
closer the declaration to the usage. And it's not perfect, but

485
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,408
we changed a little bit.

486
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,272
Not so much. It's not really a deep refactory. It's just to be more confident.

487
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,344
It's the first round, the first pass on the code,

488
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,416
when improving our mental model about it

489
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,976
and trying to clean up some mess.

490
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:26,820
Ok, something better you?

491
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:28,100
Yep

492
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:30,404
Can you see what's still bothering

493
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:34,244
Ok it's still very procedural code, one method, too screen high

494
00:30:34,756 --> 00:30:38,340
doing this and then doing that and then do this ok

495
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:40,132
Collection script

496
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:49,348
Yeah, Here "get the train" is useless

497
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:51,140
so we cut it

498
00:30:51,652 --> 00:30:52,676
Yeah, It is better

499
00:30:52,932 --> 00:30:56,004
Now, the problem is we

500
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:02,916
still share the "train", but this one normally return the domain object, not a kind of JSON.

501
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:06,500
We will see that a trend that have a physical of proxy

502
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,924
to external web API will make into

503
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,300
a adaptor, for in the portal adapter pattern that we will

504
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:25,956
Have another of view before that, so don't worry if you are not aware of that, instead of returning

505
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:29,028
a string of JSON let's make that

506
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:31,076
method return as a train stones. Yeah

507
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:37,732
So that we can get rid of JSON within the Reserve method

508
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:43,108
To make it more domain and purely and not mixing technical staff with

509
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:45,412
function domain stuff. Ok for you? Yes. Still Ok for you?

510
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,556
So I discovered that the file

511
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:53,860
There is a constructor of the train

512
00:31:54,116 --> 00:32:00,260
The train, ok, we see a lot of stuff to deserialize JSON

513
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,844
This is the file actually

514
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,452
This one is not choosed

515
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:16,388
Delete, OK

516
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:20,996
this one is never used too

517
00:32:22,532 --> 00:32:23,044
Let's delete it also

518
00:32:23,556 --> 00:32:24,324


519
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,164
also this one is grey

520
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:33,796
You can split into various files maybe.. Yeah, let's delete

521
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,380
So here we are in the

522
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:39,172
Train

523
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:40,196
Class

524
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:45,828
Yeah, and Train class does not have tons of behaviors I would say except

525
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:48,388
by parsing a

526
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:51,716
JSON

527
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:53,764
My magic C#

528
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:54,788
Ok

529
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:58,372
we use a lambda. OK. Yeah.

530
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:04,772
I will move this one. There are the members of ... the properties and field of ... Ok.

531
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:10,916
 Then all we have its a constructor. Only technical stuff.

532
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:13,220


533
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:14,500
What would you suggest

534
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:20,132
If I drink

535
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:21,668
[Audience Question]

536
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:34,212
There is better location to do some JSON parsing

537
00:33:34,468 --> 00:33:37,028
but the train which is part of the domain and we should not do that here.

538
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:43,684
Let's us do that. Yeah, Ok, so do that I have to create

539
00:33:45,476 --> 00:33:47,780
a little [method] to encapsulat the code I want to move.

540
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:54,436
 This is something that we will do a lot. Extract and Move, Extract the method and move into the proper location.

541
00:33:54,692 --> 00:33:59,300
We do that a lot during the session. The first time we will do it. Ok.

542
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:01,604
I take all the code I want

543
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:03,140
To remove, To extract

544
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:04,932
This one is ok?

545
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,724


546
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:08,772


547
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:09,540


548
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,844
One more, Ok. this one. Okey.

549
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,684
The screen is very high.

550
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:24,132
So we extract method from that, and it still will be instance method. Yeah.

551
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:25,924
That

552
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,204
Train topology

553
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,764
Because while passing the JSON.

554
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,532
The thing is

555
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:33,860
Setting some value to the property of the train

556
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:36,420
That's a nice method.

557
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:37,188
 Here?

558
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:40,772
So who is extracting into a new

559
00:34:41,284 --> 00:34:42,308
Method

560
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,660
Probility to move it to continue to use this? Yeah.

561
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:51,012
A good way to see if I have some dependency because that I want to move this one

562
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:54,596
But I don't want to add dependency from this one

563
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:56,644
I know I want to be insulate

564
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,412
So

565
00:34:57,668 --> 00:34:58,692
I use static

566
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:03,044
And I have some squeezers.

567
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:04,068
Squeezes

568
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:05,860
Here and here because this is static

569
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:12,516
That's where we tried to change the second test also see if it's static, it make some error.

570
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:16,100
Yeah so how can we cut these

571
00:35:16,356 --> 00:35:17,636
Yeah relationship

572
00:35:18,404 --> 00:35:19,172


573
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:31,972
Yeah mate motion answers

574
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:39,396
Send an apology as an argument

575
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:45,796
Yeah that's a good idea but there is something I can do also it's so far

576
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:49,892
If a is not New Zealand then I increment the results it

577
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:50,916
Instead of

578
00:35:51,428 --> 00:35:54,244
Changing that value of cos of sitcom.

579
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,292
But we may be able to

580
00:35:56,548 --> 00:35:58,596
Causes of using the potty

581
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:04,996
And everytime I call the property new property is doing the computer desk so many one way of doing it

582
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,276
Something

583
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:11,396
Instead of

584
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:17,028
Lezyne v11 changing the value it will be something like

585
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:18,564
Set

586
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:25,220
Return on debt collection of sets so that as well not not at work on

587
00:36:25,732 --> 00:36:26,756
Don't want

588
00:36:28,036 --> 00:36:29,316
Not Nero auntie

589
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:30,852
Something like that

590
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:34,436
Result sorry sir cannot thank you for the match

591
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,508
Well for the last rooms

592
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,580
Isomorphic artificial Wales

593
00:36:41,348 --> 00:36:44,932
Drilling waste collection Andrews email address

594
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:47,236
It so that's not this not

595
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:53,636
So here when I was writing something like I think the list of the seats and I can't everything's well that Lundy is very

596
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:55,684
Ring all's well

597
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,316
I don't have a booking at all times his father

598
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,620
So now you can get

599
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:04,644
Rid of that

600
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,948
Familiar

601
00:37:07,204 --> 00:37:08,228
And this one

602
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:10,020
Maybe I can

603
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:11,044
Next

604
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,092
As you propose something similar

605
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:15,908
ASOS a list

606
00:37:16,676 --> 00:37:22,820
What's an intro song that's made into a fashion I shouldn't because I

607
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:24,868
Statin function

608
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,172
So

609
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:30,244
I was still the oceans furniture

610
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:31,780
I like you

611
00:37:32,804 --> 00:37:33,316
List

612
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,204
Antalya

613
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:44,068
I received a look-a-like about yesterday now

614
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,860
I return

615
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:51,492
Sorry, that message into a pension

616
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:54,820
So that's where we call it we get the results

617
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:55,844
Direction

618
00:37:57,124 --> 00:37:59,428
So since we added strength ability

619
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:02,244
University because we have to move it

620
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,780
What's the population

621
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:10,436
What is the train is because it's because it's running yeah it's a matter of

622
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:18,884
Ok maybe just trying to message you make it

623
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,652
Perfect

624
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,956
Function so we can move it

625
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:23,748
Granny off internet

626
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:28,100
Let's put it it will get back to you I haven't eaten

627
00:38:28,612 --> 00:38:30,404
Well it has been called

628
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,988
Yes

629
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:38,340
Here we have the train

630
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:43,972
So it may be interesting instead of having no didn't have energy to get the train to return on train

631
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:45,764
For men you can put that

632
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,812
Study functioning to the tenderness of his

633
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,396
So let's move

634
00:38:56,772 --> 00:38:59,332
So you must be signed into the train

635
00:39:00,356 --> 00:39:01,892
Weather.co.uk

636
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:07,268
So far we still have a crown dependency in the

637
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:11,108
In the train class between infinity Motorcycle

638
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,436
So you make it to open each user

639
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:15,716
Yes and

640
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:19,044
The goal is to change the Swan

641
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:22,628

642
00:39:23,908 --> 00:39:27,492

643
00:39:28,004 --> 00:39:31,588
Will requesting a weather API so it's a good offer

644
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,172

For the business not have to take the train or within subject

648
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:50,276
Ok so I'm trying to transform the topology

649
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:57,444
The trend on deserts of the British weather

650
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,724
So we call it that

651
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:01,796
Identification

652
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,356
But

653
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:08,196
Currently the train a dog

654
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:10,244

655
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,804

Cliff Richard to play with and remove this phone

659
00:40:25,348 --> 00:40:29,444
So we don't have any kind of references from the train to when you can off

660
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,260
Trend of Us army soldier

661
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:34,052
So that's

662
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:35,076
So

663
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,356

664
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:40,452

In here

668
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:51,460
We have some ok but we ask the train we get

669
00:40:51,972 --> 00:40:57,348
I compiled because maybe I ask Reading

670
00:40:58,116 --> 00:41:03,236
Even if it doesn't add components to Green

671
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:10,660

Well then I'm trying to talk to you who's the name for that

700
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:42,051
Actually there is a name for that

701
00:42:42,307 --> 00:42:43,587

00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:54,595
We are

706
00:42:55,107 --> 00:42:55,875
Lacking

707
00:42:57,155 --> 00:43:02,531

Harry Potter July doing all the magic

711
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,027
What I suggest

712
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:15,843
Surely it's too

713
00:43:17,123 --> 00:43:23,011
Production Gear Jordan to put it in the population in Tritton Leicester or child objects

714
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:28,131
You can show something about MOT checker

00:43:32,995 --> 00:43:39,139
Just since we were doing a lot and it seems really what will we do we have a place

719
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:45,539
Has be classed as a Wimpy Kid furniture offers on the sofa instance and the Crosby's Alexa.

720
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:49,379
So what'll we do a lot it's to extract credit

721
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:50,915
Please type the behavior

722
00:43:51,427 --> 00:43:55,523
Into a method so then you will have a method into the same type

723
00:43:56,035 --> 00:43:59,875
And then we will move it into the population in the train France

724
00:44:00,131 --> 00:44:04,227
At the end of the day would have more actually rating

725
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:09,603
New Balance

726
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:12,419

Lottery

728
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:16,515
We will do that

729
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:18,819
Ok

730
00:44:19,587 --> 00:44:25,731
This train reserve seats personal analysis the first Middle School attendance should not

731
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:28,035
Maximum capacity of the train

732
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,339
I suggested recycle message here

733
00:44:31,107 --> 00:44:37,251
But maybe does not it does not exceed does not exceed

734
00:44:37,763 --> 00:44:39,299
Overall

735
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:42,371
Friends episode in concert

736
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:43,651

737
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:45,187

738
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:47,235
Depression

739
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:49,539
Diversity

740
00:44:50,051 --> 00:44:54,403
I will make us a non static method and primaquine to be able to move it

741
00:44:54,915 --> 00:44:55,427
Isn't it

742
00:44:56,195 --> 00:45:00,803
So here I strike that two minutes with that method

743
00:45:01,571 --> 00:45:02,851
Where should I

744
00:45:03,107 --> 00:45:04,387
Move it

745
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:05,923
Going to

746
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:08,995
The training and everything

747
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:10,787
If I said

748
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:11,811
6 tomorrow

749
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:18,211
Azure Python passing arguments to an instance of an argument so you can easily move that day

750
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:24,099
Trainer has a train does not exceed over altering capacity

751
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:27,683
If I want to replace number of seats

752
00:45:27,939 --> 00:45:28,451
Ok

753
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:35,107
Actually what we have here is available seats

754
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:40,483
Real building list of available seats at School of Massage Windsor

755
00:45:40,995 --> 00:45:42,275
Final elements

756
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:43,811

00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:45,347
Filezilla

758
00:45:45,603 --> 00:45:46,371
Nonsense

759
00:45:47,907 --> 00:45:50,979
Turn on statistics on solar movies

760
00:45:53,027 --> 00:45:53,795
So here

761
00:45:54,307 --> 00:45:58,915
If the train does not exceed if I request does not exceed the maximum capacity

762
00:45:59,427 --> 00:46:00,963
Where to find sum of elements

763
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:04,035
Actually

764
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:08,387
They said that we may introduce here instead of that

765
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:09,155
When you finish

766
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:10,435
NBA profit

767
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,251
Just pretend

768
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:15,299
Allocation

769
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:17,603
A specification

770
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:18,371
Yes

771
00:46:23,235 --> 00:46:28,867
Yeah except of course at the end of the day we will need to try 1800 Portsmouth

772
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:33,475
Before that's the don't expect was talking a lot about whether I should attend

773
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:36,547
Set a rear bottom cassette for fine

774
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:39,107
So I think it's so sweet

775
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:42,435
Instead of just dealing with available seats a list of Sith

776
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:45,251
There's a vendor distance of possession from that

777
00:46:45,763 --> 00:46:46,275
But

778
00:46:50,627 --> 00:46:52,931

779
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:58,819
Original iPhone we are improving the colour blue are at something to to show you

780
00:46:59,075 --> 00:47:01,123
Yeah maybe

781
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:05,219
Some people know in Japan

782
00:47:05,475 --> 00:47:11,363
It's a tool to check the dependencies that it exists the architect for Java

783
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:13,667
Of C++

784
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:20,067
Navigational in your code and the Rising Sun

785
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:26,723
Warning forever and we were working with you thanks Mike I don't have anybody anyway

786
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:33,123
Ask him to introduce somewhere to check that turns photos into Cambridge

787
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:39,523
Author of the name Enterprise it's not a release and we tried to imagine imagine

788
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:45,923
Can you have a team you have a legacy card and you know the vocabulary of the next

789
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:47,971
Red Aurora

790
00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:54,627
Scorpio card should rely on your ability language and we see we have some problem and

791
00:47:56,163 --> 00:48:02,307
As you can see we have the list of program and the world not matching correctly

792
00:48:02,563 --> 00:48:04,867
Letters of a gamma camera

793
00:48:05,123 --> 00:48:06,915
We have to

794
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:13,571
Enter a list of words that are part of Oldham in Lancashire

795
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:19,971
Reclamation fruitfield

796
00:48:20,227 --> 00:48:23,811
Manual and automatic

797
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:30,723
What is cheering alpha I think it would be an interesting way to make some

798
00:48:30,979 --> 00:48:35,331
Forgot to issue a kind of smell about that

799
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:41,731
So Ryan's what was the results for the 3

800
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:45,827
Yeah I don't want to

801
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:52,483
Ok so let's get back to to the business we have a solicitor

802
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:53,507
Available seats

803
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:55,811
I think that we change that

804
00:48:56,323 --> 00:49:00,931
Send signature on that by introducing the concept of inheritance

805
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:03,235

And then what we do is to iterate or every citizen resolution attempt to assign materials

929
00:55:24,419 --> 00:55:25,443
Maybe we can

930
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:27,235
Attack the messenger

931
00:55:27,747 --> 00:55:31,331

Ok

943
00:56:02,051 --> 00:56:08,195
If we look at the implementation just too funny to fail all we take that looking at house and sign it

944
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:09,475

948
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:28,931
The process is to build a reservation agent

949
00:56:29,443 --> 00:56:33,027
And at the end of the day to transform it into hibernation

950
00:56:33,795 --> 00:56:36,867
So yes but I wasn't saying that

951
00:56:37,379 --> 00:56:40,451

952
00:56:40,707 --> 00:56:41,475

953
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:46,339

Then we used to set it into the hospital so intricate Benidorm

961
00:57:17,571 --> 00:57:20,387
Then we clear it interesting

962
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:26,787
Weekly rates and an unconscious changing the glow in the stretching mediatek Street II

965
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:35,747
Ok I hope it's worth

966
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:38,307
And then we said

967
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:39,331

00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:50,595
Attach where we only save stuff

972
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:58,275
But think about the hour

973
00:57:58,531 --> 00:57:59,299
Ivana

974
00:57:59,555 --> 00:58:01,347
Windjammer correctly

975
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:03,139
It's a mistake

976
00:58:03,395 --> 00:58:06,467
As we said before we completely older

977
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:07,747
Khomeini

978
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:08,771
So

979
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:11,331
Autocar venues self service

980
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,147
And why we cash

981

HR department waiting staff

982
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:17,987
It's a mistake

983
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:22,339
You can change it and say yes it says it's going to stupid

984
00:58:22,595 --> 00:58:23,619
Think I would say

985
00:58:24,387 --> 00:58:26,947
Miss Katrina Isabella switch up

986
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:28,995
I remove it here

987
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:32,067
Animals that swim of that sand

988
00:58:32,323 --> 00:58:33,091

Nationbuilder

990
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:51,011
This is a discussion we we we may have with the National

00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:52,291
Thisisnottingham

992
00:58:52,803 --> 00:58:56,387
Recording before win because it's not the first time we run the session.

993
00:58:56,643 --> 00:59:02,787
Yes you're over that this is something that we discussed

994
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,091
Technical details with saying that

995
00:59:05,347 --> 00:59:06,627
Retained amores

996
00:59:06,883 --> 00:59:09,699
Stuff that we get at that time is it correct

997
00:59:09,955 --> 00:59:11,747
According to you

998
00:59:12,003 --> 00:59:13,283
So yeah

999
00:59:15,587 --> 00:59:19,171
So ok we

1000
00:59:19,427 --> 00:59:21,475
Directors lodge massage

1001
00:59:21,731 --> 00:59:26,595
We get a train then we asked to train

1002
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:27,875
Alex

1003
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:31,971
Overheard in the other twin capacity 3 ask princess yet

1004
00:59:32,227 --> 00:59:37,603
Adjustable bookcase remember that I should I dance then we check if it's fulfill that

1005

Outdoor Pursuits

1007
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:43,491
The house in the 24th fences

Wrist tattoo next to the Limit

1009
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:49,123
Then we Oscar booking assholes

1010
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:52,963
Then we assign the booking office and then we booked the seats

1011
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:56,547
And then we return the there isn't

1012
00:59:56,803 --> 01:00:00,387
I don't know phone you but now the Mercedes one screen hi

1013
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:06,275
We are addressing a little bit more the concept of the domain and we

1014
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:12,163
After the spreading the news goes into the popular location the Twin Towers Malaysia

1015
01:00:12,419 --> 01:00:13,187
The

1016
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,979
The seats also

1017
01:00:15,235 --> 01:00:17,539
The resolution attempt also

1018
01:00:19,331 --> 01:00:22,659
Yes I return money

1019
01:00:23,171 --> 01:00:26,755
No what would you suggest because it's important to be time boxed

1020
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,827
Haha because I mean you can improve god a lot

1021
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,619
What time we have an objective

1022
01:00:32,131 --> 01:00:33,411
Celebrity brewers

1023
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:37,507
How to fix a bag

1024
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:38,531
Concept

1025
01:00:40,835 --> 01:00:42,115
Return Tesco

1026
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:49,283
Yep absolutely no idea what you're saying that in you what weekend is to get rid of that synergies on here

1027
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:53,379
Any set to return to Amazon

1028
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:55,171
And then return

1029
01:00:55,427 --> 01:00:59,523
Itasca because I was on here so that December 3rd is purely Dublin

1030
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:05,155
No strangers on inside a simply recharging the oven in stock

1031
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,179
Will do that

1032
01:01:06,439 --> 01:01:07,975
we will do that in a circle

1033
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:12,839
but before that we would like to introduce the missing concept

1034
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:14,375
because

1035
01:01:15,143 --> 01:01:16,679
when we enter BuildReservationAttempt here

1036
01:01:18,727 --> 01:01:20,775
we build it from the

1037
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:25,383
train perspective and not from the coach perspective

1038
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:28,455
we use all seats with no notion of coach

1039
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:33,575
So how to introduce the concept of coach according to you what will be yours

1040
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:59,943
Basiclly the topology is taken from the name of every seats...every seats has the name including a1 a2 a3 b4...

1041
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:04,551
A is the name of the coach...is the name of coach

1042
01:02:04,807 --> 01:02:06,599
it's an implict where I'll figure it out these seats belongs to the coach

1043
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:13,767
yeah absolutely..good idea

1044
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:17,351
but how to introduce it

1045
01:02:17,607 --> 01:02:18,119
right now

1046
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:20,679
what will be your next move?

1047
01:02:24,263 --> 01:02:29,127
yeah okay, but how to do that?

1048
01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:30,919
start by what you suggested if you have a keyboard

1049
01:02:38,343 --> 01:02:39,111
Yeah

1050
01:02:41,415 --> 01:02:43,719
Why not? But we will start with a widget test...absolutely...

1051
01:02:43,975 --> 01:02:47,303
from the train we will get ...

1052
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,119
we will check that the a train exposed coaches for instance

1053
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:52,935
 for example

1054
01:02:53,959 --> 01:02:56,519
Because we totally addictive of

1055
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:57,799
TDD

1056
01:02:58,567 --> 01:02:59,591
And

1057
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:01,383
we want you

1058
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:05,479
To create so let's add a TrainShould...should...fixture...

1059
01:03:05,735 --> 01:03:08,807
But so far we don't...we only have some  architecture tests

1060
01:03:09,575 --> 01:03:11,879
That's total system should do

1061
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:13,927
Do this do that do it so we have three tests

1062
01:03:14,183 --> 01:03:19,047
And here ...to be our first unit test I would say

1063
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:21,607
It's a time? should

1064
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:24,935
And maybe...to be...should expose coaches something like that?

1065
01:03:26,471 --> 01:03:27,495
So we get a train

1066
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:30,823
so should TrainShould expose coaches?

1067
01:03:38,503 --> 01:03:40,551
I move this one because I don't...

1068
01:03:44,135 --> 01:03:45,415
Should expose coaches

1069
01:03:46,695 --> 01:03:47,207
should...expose...coaches

1070
01:03:48,231 --> 01:03:48,743
so...yeah...

1071
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:59,239
it totally about it...yeah...yeah...yeah

1072
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:03,335
Actually here I had even in mind some new rules for the related to the coach even he first to fix by then

1073
01:04:03,847 --> 01:04:04,359
But

1074
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:06,407
Because money

1075
01:04:06,663 --> 01:04:12,807
But he has something in mind to consolidate and to a new business rules

1076
01:04:13,063 --> 01:04:13,575
Such as

1077
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:14,855
We should not

1078
01:04:15,367 --> 01:04:19,463
Feed a coach more than 40%

1079
01:04:19,975 --> 01:04:20,487
for instance

1080
01:04:20,743 --> 01:04:25,351
and step like so it we need the population through to make it

1081
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:38,151
So Far we need it

1082
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:41,735
We need to play with the coach

1083
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:44,295
We need to ask it...to ask it

1084
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:45,319
that's yes

1085
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:51,719
If you want to keep it completely private implementation details for your detail capsulated

1086
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:52,487
we won't write that

1087
01:04:52,999 --> 01:04:55,047
So just for

1088
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,607
some explanation because I use a

1089
01:04:58,631 --> 01:05:00,423
A snake

1090
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,727
name because we

1091
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:09,127
We use it in the tests to mock some situations...this is a tenth topology table

1092
01:05:09,383 --> 01:05:15,527
so he will probably have built a spawning...it's a way to qualify the topology

1093
01:05:15,783 --> 01:05:21,415
And it's good to use because I know in this topology

1094
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:23,719
I have two coach and

1095
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:25,767
we stand seat for each coach so it's the reason why I use this one

1096
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:29,351
So you in your test associated a train

1097
01:05:29,863 --> 01:05:32,423
Ok providing in the Train

1098
01:05:32,935 --> 01:05:35,239
The list of seats adapted from that train

1099
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:36,775
topology

1100
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:37,543
Ok

1101
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:39,335
So let's check

1102
01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:42,151
train...coaches...

1103
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:43,687
Yeah I'm sorry

1104
01:05:45,991 --> 01:05:46,503
And

1105
01:05:47,015 --> 01:05:49,575
I hate coaches but it doesn't exist at this time

1106
01:05:51,623 --> 01:05:52,903
We need to

1107
01:05:54,695 --> 01:05:55,719
A size of

1108
01:05:56,231 --> 01:05:59,047
two...because they have two coaches from the train topology

1109
01:06:01,863 --> 01:06:05,703
And you can also check that every coach has 10 seats maybe

1110
01:06:07,495 --> 01:06:13,639
It is long because I think it to be like a dictionary for half hour break....coaches["A"], coaches["B"]

1111
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:16,199
Coaches["A"]

1112
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:19,015
the seats...dot seats

1113
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:21,319
A size 10

1114
01:06:21,575 --> 01:06:23,623
Because every coach...ya

1115
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:25,927
Ok just to

1116
01:06:26,439 --> 01:06:31,047
Just to make it expose what we	have with in train topology...okay...

1117
01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:33,607
So it's start to generate something

1118
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:35,399
Yeah...Ok

1119
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:38,983
So you said the dictionary

1120
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:42,567
Name

1121
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:46,407
Coach

1122
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:48,711
doesn't exists yet

1123
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:51,527
The same we will create

1124
01:06:51,783 --> 01:06:52,295
type

1125
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:55,111
for Coach...Yeah I would create it because...right time

1126
01:06:57,415 --> 01:07:00,231
So here the train will have

1127
01:07:00,743 --> 01:07:02,279
A list of coach

1128
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,071
And now I can

1129
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:06,119
start as a dictionary

1130
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:14,823
If we have more time we won't expose it as a dictionary also we expose that a read-only dictionary

1131
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:17,383
or even better a concept

1132
01:07:18,407 --> 01:07:20,199
The delegate type for that but

1133
01:07:20,455 --> 01:07:24,295
Since I would like to show you a lot of other step we want

1134
01:07:25,063 --> 01:07:27,111
right here but

1135
01:07:27,367 --> 01:07:28,903
To loop on the seats

1136
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:32,487
So here we dig into the concept D I G would be

1137
01:07:32,743 --> 01:07:37,863
ok I've got a list of seats we said that the name of coach was an implict

1138
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:41,191
information passed of the name of every seats

1139
01:07:41,959 --> 01:07:45,543
So for every seat we just have to check if there is a coach

1140
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:46,567
With their name

1141
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:49,639
Because seats has a proper capacity coach named

1142
01:07:50,151 --> 01:07:53,735
And if we don't have an entry in the dictionary yet from that

1143
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:55,783
Coach name let's

1144
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:56,551
add it

1145
01:07:57,063 --> 01:07:57,831
to the dictionary

1146
01:08:00,903 --> 01:08:01,415
Sorry

1147
01:08:05,511 --> 01:08:11,655
Yes we can use an link...yeah. you have a query on seats for the beginning of algorithm I prefer to show without thinking

1148
01:08:13,447 --> 01:08:14,215
And

1149
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:20,359
by use to set a new coach...we also set a new coach...and providing info name...set the coach name maybe

1150
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:24,199
So

1151
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:30,855
we iterate on every seats of the train for everyone of them

1152
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:35,975
we added the relating coach into the dictionary on the fly

1153
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:37,767
Then we have to

1154
01:08:38,023 --> 01:08:38,791
add the seats

1155
01:08:41,863 --> 01:08:42,887
so...coach name

1156
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:50,823
First step second step is to add the seat into the coach

1157
01:08:54,407 --> 01:08:55,175
So...coaches...

1158
01:08:55,687 --> 01:08:57,735
...coaches...array...seat

1159
01:08:57,991 --> 01:08:58,759
seat dot coach name maybe

1160
01:08:59,783 --> 01:09:00,807


1161
01:09:01,063 --> 01:09:02,087
I introduced available

1162
01:09:03,879 --> 01:09:05,159
we called it..can newCoach? No?

1163
01:09:08,743 --> 01:09:09,255
Yes

1164
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:10,791
Ok...why not

1165
01:09:13,863 --> 01:09:14,631
new coach

1166
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:15,911
add...seat...

1167
01:09:18,983 --> 01:09:25,127
Are you doing that for to expose it to use the kind of ? expression but you want to make it work and then we can refactor something like that

1168
01:09:26,151 --> 01:09:28,711
It is correct...ok...ok..

1169
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,367
Now

1170
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:39,463
Ok. Ok

1171
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:41,511
actually you have to ......I have to refactor at first

1172
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:47,911
the coache is here

1173
01:09:48,167 --> 01:09:50,727
coach..coach....coach...and on that coach..you had the seats

1174
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:51,751
So...ok

1175
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:55,847
So I had to

1176
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:58,919
I suppose I have kind of list of seats

1177
01:10:01,479 --> 01:10:01,991
So you are

1178
01:10:02,503 --> 01:10:07,367
What glue do you use to make USB data switch for handling unit

1179
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:08,391
we will need to make a coach

1180
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:15,815
A nice place to to find our list of seats I would say

1181
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:18,119
But

1182
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:19,143
There is

1183
01:10:19,399 --> 01:10:21,959
something that bother me a little bit  in here. But

1184
01:10:22,471 --> 01:10:23,239
I'll let you finish

1185
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:25,799
I've like to see greener

1186
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:28,871
The greener

1187
01:10:33,991 --> 01:10:37,063
I see, they are green

1188
01:10:39,623 --> 01:10:42,439
oh, no, no..just compile...I think is not compiling

1189
01:10:43,463 --> 01:10:44,231
anymore, something like that

1190
01:10:44,999 --> 01:10:51,143
Oh, yeah...That expose size of seats....topology....encapsulate...and

1191
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:55,239
seats

1192
01:10:55,495 --> 01:10:56,775
here...should be green...yeah...it's

1193
01:11:02,407 --> 01:11:04,711
ok....I don't really like that kind of

1194
01:11:05,223 --> 01:11:05,735
We

1195
01:11:06,247 --> 01:11:09,575
Add a seats to a coach...we change the coach

1196
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:10,855
Actually

1197
01:11:11,111 --> 01:11:12,391
If you have more time

1198
01:11:12,903 --> 01:11:14,439
There is something I would like to do

1199
01:11:15,975 --> 01:11:19,303
It's even to make it everything immutable

1200
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:22,119
Because what we do is

1201
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:27,495
basically with when you reserve...we want to reserve	some seats, we get train apology

1202
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:29,799
Which is something that we don't own

1203
01:11:30,055 --> 01:11:31,591
It's coming from the outside world

1204
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:32,871
We work on it

1205
01:11:34,151 --> 01:11:39,015
And I really don't want us to be tempted somehow to keep it in touch

1206
01:11:39,783 --> 01:11:40,807
because it will be stupid

1207
01:11:41,575 --> 01:11:47,719
And I would like to offer the fact that's when we get a train apology it should be immutable all I can do is to work with

1208
01:11:48,743 --> 01:11:51,559
To find some information or to build reservation attempt

1209
01:11:51,815 --> 01:11:54,119
But I don't want to allow my mates

1210
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:57,703
are new joiners in the team...it start

1211
01:11:57,959 --> 01:12:02,567
to...to...break that by introducing a cache and a state well

1212
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:03,591
I don't want

1213
01:12:03,847 --> 01:12:04,359
to be

1214
01:12:04,615 --> 01:12:10,759
So if we had more time when I would like to do is to make your everything immutable, the train will be immutable,the coaches will be

1215
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:12,551
immutable and the seats also

1216
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:14,599
the only

1217
01:12:14,855 --> 01:12:17,671
things that will be mutable is the reservation attempt

1218
01:12:18,951 --> 01:12:24,071
you see the a formal reservation attempt which will be kind of entity that has a life cycle and $%^&?

1219
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:27,911
But the time changed all over the time

1220
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:31,751
At the end I will transform the reservation attemp to reservation

1221
01:12:32,007 --> 01:12:33,799
And the reseravation would be immutable

1222
01:12:34,055 --> 01:12:36,871
the reservation to reservation....we it's

1223
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:38,663
yeah, you have question?

1224
01:12:46,599 --> 01:12:52,743
Sorry?yeah...yeah...yeah...Absolutely....is of reasoning also if we

1225
01:12:52,999 --> 01:12:54,279
get back to the

1226
01:12:54,535 --> 01:12:55,815
addseats

1227
01:12:56,327 --> 01:13:00,935
What would like is to maybe to one for seats it's to use what we call a closure of operation

1228
01:13:01,191 --> 01:13:02,727
its meaning the coach

1229
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:06,567
We have a method which is addSeats so I can add seats for the coache

1230
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:10,151
But instead of mutating me the coache instance

1231
01:13:10,407 --> 01:13:13,223
What we would like is to for that guy to reach on me

1232
01:13:13,735 --> 01:13:15,015
The New Coach

1233
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:16,551
a new sort of coach installs

1234
01:13:16,807 --> 01:13:17,319
So

1235
01:13:17,575 --> 01:13:20,903
I called method...add seats on a coach instance

1236
01:13:21,415 --> 01:13:24,743
All it can do is to return your new instance

1237
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:26,535
With that seats involved

1238
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:32,679
But without changing the previous instance here that when I call the addSeats

1239
01:13:32,935 --> 01:13:33,447
Listen

1240
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:34,983
So

1241
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:39,847
The benefits is the first time with ability	for of course or for passion but also reduce the coupling

1242
01:13:40,103 --> 01:13:43,175
It's easier to move code

1243
01:13:43,431 --> 01:13:44,711
Here the coach

1244
01:13:45,223 --> 01:13:46,503
stand by itself somehow

1245
01:13:46,759 --> 01:13:50,855
you know...method on the coach which are mean you have the source of coach

1246
01:13:51,367 --> 01:13:57,511
For if I want to move that it's more easy than if the coach where related to a new type which is releated to a new types and s...

1247
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,047
step like that.

1248
01:13:59,559 --> 01:14:01,095
Okay for everyone

1249
01:14:01,607 --> 01:14:02,375
Ok yeah

1250
01:14:17,223 --> 01:14:23,367
In any case it's important to discuss with domain expert

1251
01:14:23,623 --> 01:14:25,671
unfortunately we used to do that session with one domain expert

1252
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:26,951
on stage with us

1253
01:14:27,207 --> 01:14:28,999
and we asked some questions since he's not here we note a lot of stuff

1254
01:14:29,255 --> 01:14:31,303
so there is a lot of implict you know in our head

1255
01:14:31,559 --> 01:14:35,143
But yes you're right you should have some kind of discussion

1256
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:36,935
But

1257
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:43,847
Here is much more an implementation detail I would say

1258
01:14:44,103 --> 01:14:46,919
It's to all folks the fact that I no want to talk any kind of

1259
01:14:47,175 --> 01:14:50,503
states relating to something that I don't

1260
01:14:52,551 --> 01:14:53,319
I'm not

1261
01:14:53,575 --> 01:14:55,879
owner of the topology of the train I'm just a user

1262
01:14:56,135 --> 01:14:59,463
and every time a request is it getting back to me

1263
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:02,023
Get a snapshot...walk over snapshots

1264
01:15:02,535 --> 01:15:05,607
through my concept of domain and then make a reservation

1265
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:07,911
So

1266
01:15:21,223 --> 01:15:26,599
Yeah, absolutely

1267
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:33,767
Ok I think maybe it's not pop up...yeah...absolutely...okay...so...instead of changing the coach here

1268
01:15:34,023 --> 01:15:36,327
let's switch a new instance of coach

1269
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:39,143
make it a coach of attention here

1270
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:46,055
So I didn't seats it doesn't mutate the existing coach which will only return

1271
01:15:46,311 --> 01:15:47,079
a new coach instance

1272
01:15:49,895 --> 01:15:50,407
Coach

1273
01:15:50,663 --> 01:15:51,687
Ok

1274
01:15:51,943 --> 01:15:52,711
with seat name

1275
01:15:55,015 --> 01:15:55,783
with what?

1276
01:15:56,295 --> 01:15:57,063
With a list

1277
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:57,831
a new list?

1278
01:15:59,879 --> 01:16:00,647
yeah

1279
01:16:00,903 --> 01:16:07,047
Acutally session is best form session of three hours we have made in paris ^&*()?

1280
01:16:07,303 --> 01:16:11,399
expect outstage our left floor forward

1281
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:17,799
I guess museum story with tons of stuff so

1282
01:16:18,055 --> 01:16:21,383
we had to pick a fight for that short version of two hours... there are many things that we may improve what them about

1283
01:16:23,431 --> 01:16:28,295
So we can't find that the coach seats a train really value types

1284
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:29,319
So we want to

1285
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:33,927
go into that we will only make that coach immutable

1286
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:36,743
Maybe

1287
01:16:38,023 --> 01:16:40,839
There's lots of things to me to improve...and respect the

1288
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:42,887
priacy a sure

1289
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:45,959
Yes

1290
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:47,751
to avoid the

1291
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:50,055
The big issue

1292
01:16:51,847 --> 01:16:54,663
to implement the same constructor as before ok

1293
01:16:55,431 --> 01:16:57,479
So now we have to fix it

1294
01:16:57,991 --> 01:16:58,503
the core

1295
01:16:59,015 --> 01:16:59,527
Yeah prefectly

1296
01:17:07,463 --> 01:17:08,231
Because existing code

1297
01:17:08,487 --> 01:17:09,255
was doing that

1298
01:17:09,511 --> 01:17:10,791
so its...maybe steps you know

1299
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:15,911
you fix...this...call...in...^&*(..

1300
01:17:16,935 --> 01:17:21,543
So time to change it and to...so

1301
01:17:21,799 --> 01:17:23,335
So will be to get the coach

1302
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:24,615
To add seats

1303
01:17:25,895 --> 01:17:26,407
So

1304
01:17:26,663 --> 01:17:27,687
through it...new coach

1305
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:30,759
Yeah, new coach and then to stalk the new coach by

1306
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:33,319
a ball into dictionary

1307
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:37,415
So it's still red here?

1308
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:41,767
But I guess that after saving that new coach value

1309
01:17:42,023 --> 01:17:44,327
Into the dictionary it will be green again

1310
01:17:45,351 --> 01:17:45,863
Fully?...new coach

1311
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:48,679
That's right

1312
01:17:49,191 --> 01:17:50,471
Inevitable

1313
01:18:10,183 --> 01:18:10,951
Yeah...yeah

1314
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:19,655
It was in the test

1315
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,751
and the coach...okay

1316
01:18:31,175 --> 01:18:31,687
here

1317
01:18:32,711 --> 01:18:34,759
Unless you get back to the unit test again

1318
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,999
Oh yes yes...you're right

1319
01:18:45,255 --> 01:18:46,791
completely right

1320
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:58,823
we will do that because we would like to show you a picture second architecture and lots of other steps...but yes you're right...you're right

1321
01:19:03,431 --> 01:19:09,319
Yeah but absolutely that was next point actually we have a train which has

1322
01:19:10,087 --> 01:19:11,623
exposed a list of seats and trying to expose the list of coach

1323
01:19:11,879 --> 01:19:15,975
Because all seats belong to the coaches so what we should do is

1324
01:19:16,231 --> 01:19:19,815
Instead of adding duplicates collection on the train

1325
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:21,863
instead to have a projection

1326
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:24,679
And the list of seats for the train must be the

1327
01:19:24,935 --> 01:19:27,751
the projection of all the seats of every coach

1328
01:19:27,751 --> 01:19:28,007
of the train

1329
01:19:28,007 --> 01:19:29,031
so let's do that

1330
01:19:29,287 --> 01:19:32,359
select mini something like that

1331
01:19:32,871 --> 01:19:34,151
coaches

1332
01:19:35,431 --> 01:19:36,455
let's take every coach

1333
01:19:36,967 --> 01:19:39,527
And return the value

1334
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:41,063
select many coach

1335
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:47,463
for every seats

1336
01:19:47,975 --> 01:19:49,767
change to c

1337
01:19:50,023 --> 01:19:50,791
I just c dot

1338
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:51,559
seats

1339
01:19:55,143 --> 01:19:56,167
toList

1340
01:19:56,679 --> 01:19:57,191
to a newList

1341
01:19:59,239 --> 01:20:02,823
with this kind of linked you again but it's we met a projection

1342
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:03,847
we take

1343
01:20:04,103 --> 01:20:05,895
All the seats on every coach

1344
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:09,223
And we return it at the this that's it for the entire train

1345
01:20:09,735 --> 01:20:13,319
So we have this one? we don't need to set it anymore because it will be

1346
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:14,344
a get on me...a property

1347
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:19,464
Ok

1348
01:20:23,048 --> 01:20:25,352
We need we have the coach...compiled

1349
01:20:25,608 --> 01:20:27,144
Yeah it's good now

1350
01:20:28,936 --> 01:20:31,752
So maybe we can maybe we can fix the bug

1351
01:20:32,008 --> 01:20:32,776
What do you think

1352
01:20:34,312 --> 01:20:35,336
So...Ok

1353
01:20:36,872 --> 01:20:39,688
Absolutely...villages?...yes

1354
01:20:39,944 --> 01:20:43,016
idea is to move the findAvailableSeats or the buildReservationAttempt

1355
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:44,296
to the coach level

1356
01:20:44,552 --> 01:20:46,600
Because if we asked to the train level

1357
01:20:47,368 --> 01:20:49,416
There is no way of

1358
01:20:49,672 --> 01:20:53,256
properly there is a way that kind of crappy

1359
01:20:53,512 --> 01:20:54,536
so let's delegated it

1360
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:57,608
To the to The Coach so I'm removing

1361
01:20:57,864 --> 01:20:58,376
This one

1362
01:20:58,632 --> 01:21:01,704
So we only do this the test it will be red and red

1363
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,240
green step

1364
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:08,872
So it's come back to the WebTicket

1365
01:21:09,128 --> 01:21:12,456
and as you suggested

1366
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:14,248
Maybe the

1367
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,088
buildReservationAttempt is in charge to be verified

1368
01:21:19,368 --> 01:21:21,928
and to tweet

1369
01:21:22,696 --> 01:21:23,464
Something new

1370
01:21:25,768 --> 01:21:29,864
Maybe we can change the algorithm

1371
01:21:30,376 --> 01:21:31,144
but respect algorithm

1372
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,192
so I based on the coach

1373
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,776
Let's put that

1374
01:21:37,032 --> 01:21:39,336
logic of looking at seats

1375
01:21:39,592 --> 01:21:40,616
at coach level

1376
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:43,688
So for iterate every coach

1377
01:21:44,712 --> 01:21:49,832
So we really have you maybe the same thing build a reservation attempt...yeah...I would like to use this one

1378
01:21:51,368 --> 01:21:52,136
please coach

1379
01:21:52,648 --> 01:21:54,696
beat me build reservation attemp if you can

1380
01:21:55,464 --> 01:21:55,976
Ok

1381
01:21:59,304 --> 01:22:02,120
And returning you a reservcation attempt

1382
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,680
ReservcationAttempt

1383
01:22:05,192 --> 01:22:06,728
Is reservationAttempt

1384
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:07,752
Adele

1385
01:22:13,384 --> 01:22:14,920
And if...reservation attempt

1386
01:22:15,176 --> 01:22:16,200
IsFulfilled

1387
01:22:16,456 --> 01:22:16,968
Ok

1388
01:22:17,736 --> 01:22:19,528
Then return

1389
01:22:20,296 --> 01:22:22,088
reservationAttempt

1390
01:22:22,344 --> 01:22:26,952
If not, we continue to iterate it on the next coach ask to the same thing once we have

1391
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,488
at least one coach

1392
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,072
provide us its fulfill another reservation attempt we are happy with that

1393
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,352
So

1394
01:22:33,608 --> 01:22:37,192
This one is actually the code I would like to

1395
01:22:37,448 --> 01:22:39,496
Completely get pasted

1396
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,032
In

1397
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,872
So let's create a method

1398
01:22:51,272 --> 01:22:52,808
Okay, and I don't like copy and paste actually

1399
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,136
but in that case it

1400
01:22:57,928 --> 01:22:59,208
So justified

1401
01:22:59,464 --> 01:23:05,608
it's green....so we just fix the bug by doing that...maybe you can a red green refactor

1402
01:23:08,936 --> 01:23:11,240
Something to refact buildReservationAttempt to the train level

1403
01:23:11,752 --> 01:23:14,568
we still...let some code

1404
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:15,336
So

1405
01:23:15,848 --> 01:23:18,664
based on the  what's on 'seat'

1406
01:23:19,176 --> 01:23:21,224
here we have some kind of

1407
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:27,112
...copy code so let's replace it with a linq...request

1408
01:23:28,648 --> 01:23:32,744
So take me please all seats where BookingRef is empty

1409
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,560
is empty...string dot is null or empty

1410
01:23:36,328 --> 01:23:42,472
if we create a method also yeah...yeah...and

1411
01:23:42,728 --> 01:23:47,336
take the number of seats request count

1412
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:49,896
So here we are projecting a list of

1413
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,432
Seats

1414
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:57,576
That are available and then we have a list of seats and available seats and then we take

1415
01:23:58,088 --> 01:24:04,232
The first three four whatever number we asked...and I replace this one...it does

1416
01:24:04,488 --> 01:24:07,816
Exactly the same thing of the foreach loop we have seats here

1417
01:24:09,096 --> 01:24:11,656
To prove it you just have to

1418
01:24:12,424 --> 01:24:14,216
you have to...just to...get all of them

1419
01:24:14,472 --> 01:24:18,824
I remove

1420
01:24:20,104 --> 01:24:20,616
Ok

1421
01:24:22,408 --> 01:24:24,200
Ok you remove it

1422
01:24:25,736 --> 01:24:26,504
Here

1423
01:24:28,808 --> 01:24:29,576
Oops

1424
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,112
I made a mistake

1425
01:24:31,368 --> 01:24:32,136
Now it's ok

1426
01:24:32,392 --> 01:24:38,536
So what we can do maybe seems seat constructor missed up anything to attract mosquitoes

1427
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:43,656
things so here is quite difficult with

1428
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:48,520
Inshallah ok

1429
01:24:52,616 --> 01:24:57,736
The target method we should be

1430
01:24:58,248 --> 01:24:59,016
isAvailable

1431
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,320
Since we are working on seats

1432
01:25:02,088 --> 01:25:03,880
so non-static public

1433
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:05,928
And we will

1434
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:10,280
extract method and then we will move it into the seats and the seats level

1435
01:25:10,536 --> 01:25:11,048
So

1436
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,328
Move it

1437
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:17,192
So here now if you can zoom on the link us with a request

1438
01:25:17,704 --> 01:25:21,800
light on the seats and we take all the seats that are available

1439
01:25:22,312 --> 01:25:25,384
And we take the first number that we need it

1440
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:36,648
We need it. That's we introduced that eariler for the each fulfilled

1441
01:25:37,928 --> 01:25:42,792
for another reservation attempt I should to be

1442
01:25:43,048 --> 01:25:45,352
to be able to say fulfilled obtain a good reservation it's design choice...yeah...

1443
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:47,400
Ok

1444
01:25:47,656 --> 01:25:50,216
We happy because then we fix a bug

1445
01:25:50,472 --> 01:25:55,848
fix bug we can imporving a little bit in the code....yeah...

1
01:25:53,670 --> 01:26:04,620
yeah maybe we can have a tiny part
about aggregates yeah so just a tiny

2
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:09,000
part about aggregates. Aggregates is a
collection of objects which is entity and value types

3
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,220
treated as a conceptual whole. Can
you see some aggregates in here

4
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:30,470
train? yeah. Is coach an aggregate? no.
why is that?[Audience]yeah some aggregates mayby immutable.

5
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:34,490
Actually it's
no because aggregates need invariants,
need business rules need something to to

6
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,560
to to
yeah to be enforced I would say. And here

7
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:49,130
the only variants we have is train level.

8
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:53,600
they must not exceed 70 percent of the
train tickets limited which is the business I

9
01:26:53,600 --> 01:27:01,130
own and the coach aggregates as to as
to to enforced when we discuss with the

10
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:05,210
domain expert he told us that he
wanted to add some new rules related to the coach.

11
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:11,000
so that coach must not be
fulfilled also at must not be exceed

12
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,980
given capacity so in that case it will
turn into an aggregate voice maybe it's

13
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:22,850
a kind of detail. But something
interesting. Train, coach and seat may

14
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:28,760
all be value types here. as we discuss
earlier if we think about the way we

15
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:33,850
interact with the external backend we
get a kind of snapshot valid from a

16
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:40,280
moment of time and we will work on that
snapshot. so we don't want to keep it in
cache. We just want to work with all those

17
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:49,880
aggregates. fine cells so to enforce that
we can make it all value types. actually

18
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,090
in the long term Russian we that's what
we did

19
01:27:53,090 --> 01:28:03,080
so that means that some aggregates may
be completely value types also.[Audience] yeah the

20
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:10,430
trend here it most of the case it's like
this message was to it was one

21
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:15,340
case where we could have this exception [Audience]

22
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:32,519
if we have a level-two Business School
to be enforced at the coach level it.

23
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:37,289
Yeah, in the long version we do that. So so far we
improved somehow the web ticket manager

24
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:45,179
and the before it was a free screen
high, full of legacy code with lots

25
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:50,880
of legacy stuff yeah. I think we have
kind of improved a little bit it's one

26
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,309
screen high. It's using the word of the
domain within the code what we call

27
01:28:56,309 --> 01:29:02,130
ubiquitous language. we extract some
behaviors and we put them into the proper

28
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:07,769
locations, but there is still something
that botheres us. someone has told it

29
01:29:07,769 --> 01:29:15,959
before this is that we have some Json
 design into the domain method

30
01:29:15,959 --> 01:29:22,110
and we still have our Task of strings
which is also a jism. yeah what we would

31
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:28,380
like to do here is to get rid of that
design, and stuff and to replace it by

32
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:35,579
reserve. sorry, reservation. So
that the Reserve method will return a

33
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:41,249
reservation. then on the infrastructure side
side and we will transform

34
01:29:41,249 --> 01:29:45,989
the Reservation into a json version,
if we have an adapter if we have

35
01:29:45,989 --> 01:29:50,340
something pluggable. okay so I
suggest I will talk a little bit about

36
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,979
the second equation which slide. I'm
sorry

37
01:29:52,979 --> 01:30:00,179
I will work on the code you
don't see. but it will explain when we

38
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:04,380
get back to the code and like an
architecture we explain what we have done.

39
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:10,590
okay
so who is aware of what hexagonal architecture is?

40
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:18,420
okay cool what hexagonal
architecture pattern is made

41
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:24,090
by Alistair Cockburn.
I can't remember, the long time ago.

42
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:28,940
and it has many benefits. it's a pattern
at the architectural level it's known as to

43
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:40,370
embrace change it was the first idea of
Alistair was to plug and unplug external

44
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:46,460
dependencies plug and unplug stuff he
was talking about whether system able to

45
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:51,260
to be plugged with many different
standards as input and many different

46
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:56,780
stutters as output to broadcast news to
broadcast to TV to radio to whatever.
so it was kind of to have

47
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:07,220
of clean code inside and every changes
in terms of i/o or way to interact with

48
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:12,290
the system to be a non-event to be
something like you plug a plug in and

49
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:17,900
you can plug a plug in and that's it so
it's it's come with it was introduced by

50
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:25,040
that idea in mind but when we think
about it, it may allow us that we want to

51
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:30,320
first on the domain to make some code
more value, business value inside to

52
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:36,310
protect our domain code from the
technical stuff. I don't know for you but

53
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:40,790
during long time I thought it was not
even possible to properly split between

54
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:46,070
domain logic and and technical. We
tried many times that we failed a lot and

55
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:51,880
seems I discovered that pattern.
it's really a nice way to and for that

56
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:56,330
and I also want to enforce testability because
since everything is a pluggable and

57
01:31:56,330 --> 01:32:02,150
We can stub, we can mock, we can
stub the input output of the

58
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:07,730
systems, business logic inside and so for
today we will focus much more the how to

59
01:32:07,730 --> 01:32:12,350
protect our domain code. So how does it work?
It works

60
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:16,460
considering the world in two different
area there is inside and there is

61
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:21,440
outside
simple, right? No thousands of layers, no...

62
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:27,410
simply two area, the inside is a domain
it's your domain code like

63
01:32:27,410 --> 01:32:30,680
method like the train, the
reservationAttempt, the stuff like that

64
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:36,560
and the infrastructure code is at the
outside of your system. So this

65
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:39,710
is where you will find your favorite
HTTP stack,

66
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:43,520
your database drivers, your
message middleware, your favorite solution.

67
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:47,110
or whatever. This is
infrastructure side, code. which I've got
and what we want is to first

68
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:56,390
improve the domain code so we have
diversity she is some kind of putting

69
01:32:56,390 --> 01:33:03,080
some  barriers around your domain code and
defining some entry points to enter and

70
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:08,810
to leave the the domain code. So you keep
the infrasturcture code at the other

71
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:15,860
side. This is a nice capability actually
because I don't know for you but when
you start your career as a developer you

72
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:21,260
need to improve your skills, you need to
discover new thing you need to do lot

73
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:26,270
of mistakes you need to implement you
own framework in order to realize

74
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:30,140
at one point that there are some silly
stuff like implementing your framework

75
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:36,230
stuff like that. But before you focus on
the domain really, it's still important
for some new young developers to be able

76
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:43,370
to play in a kind of playground. I'm
okay with that

77
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:48,500
as much as it does not jeopardize the
business value and the project and in

78
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,800
that case I'm happy with that because
there is a kind of location where you

79
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:56,180
can play. It's a playground your infrastructure
code. You can try new technology new

80
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:01,130
stuffs without jeopardizing
the domain code. So this is what I really

81
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:05,719
like in that pattern. So how does
it work, because there are barriers

82
01:34:05,719 --> 01:34:09,560
but I need to enter and to leave the
building, I would say that, to leave the

83
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,880
domain code. So to do so in terms of
dependencies, all dependencies are

84
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,330
towards inside. believes the
infrastructure code is aware of

85
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:22,489
reference of domain code, but of course the
domain code should not be aware to any

86
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:29,110
framework. Even Jesus stuff. It seemed
like that so the domain is completely

87
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:36,770
independent from any kind of technology
even Json string or thing like that. So

88
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:42,800
to allow us to move from the
inside to the outside to ask new thing

89
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,870
to talk with external web api and do
some stuff, we will rely on ports and

90
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:53,180
adapters. And to do so we are actually
using

91
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:58,160
inversion dependency principle, so that
from the inside we can go outside and do

92
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:04,130
some stuff. Alistair Cockbrun recently
discussed with an another guy I can't

93
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:07,910
remember the name and that was
suggesting the name of configurable

94
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:12,920
dependencies. What Alistair was saying is
dependency injection principle I don't

95
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,840
really like because this is like if
negative way of formulating things. It's

96
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:23,900
you used to do that do the other way
around do the inverse so he was trying
to find a much more fluent intention way

97
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:32,660
of saying that, so they lead to
configurable dependencies so you plug

98
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:41,420
and unplug your dependencies around your main.
So if we get back to a case

99
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:47,420
here we say we have ports and adapter
to enter and to leave the domain. So

100
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:52,550
ports belongs to the domain and there
are some interfaces like lollipops here

101
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:57,440
so here I've got the IReserveSeats which
is the entry point from the
tata system. so I had through an

102
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:07,340
adapter HTTP adapter IP dot net callback
I must call an interface which is a port

103
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:14,930
I have another seat, say please reserve
me something and I get a

104
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:19,190
reservation and that adapter will do the
rotation between the reservation and the
Json version because the Json that so it

105
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:29,840
will be the proper location to do so
when I need to form a business rule

106
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,090
when I need some extra data some extra
thing if not provided by everything I

107
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:41,270
need from the beginning there are many
ways to do that but if let say I need to

108
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:47,390
ask one of the external
SSL dependency you know the three web

109
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:52,160
api we call during the process, we need
to access, we need to add something to
the outside, so to do so we asked some

110
01:36:54,940 --> 01:37:00,680
ports also made from the inside there is
IBookSeats interface there is IProvideTrainTopology

111
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:05,840
interface and there is
IGetBookingRef interface. these

112
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,270
are domain interface
the port still

113
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:14,010
belongs to the domain reason why the
lollipop is in blue

114
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:17,970
but the adapter is what belongs to infrastructure

115
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:22,170
so basically adapter is something that
maps between the infrastructure code to

116
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:28,620
the domain one and vice-versa. Is that OK for
all of you? yeah? we'll see that in

117
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:36,060
the code in a few minutes. so port and
adapter to go in and to go out. easy, right? okay

118
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:40,650
but when we try to implement it the
first time there's tons of question that
arouse and there are many ways to

119
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:50,880
do so. We'll show you one. we have to
initialize we have to init to initiate

120
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:59,520
you are to build you
have to build the stuff so I like I've

121
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,670
got a metaphor which is a key ring
metaphor to explain that to my

122
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:07,710
mate I try to explain to you. First step,
its we will talk here about the

123
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:11,700
composition of utopian application, you
know, the place on your application

124
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:17,070
where you build all your dependencies
and then voila apply the system is able

125
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:22,320
to work and to do is work okay so we're
talking about the bootstrap of your

126
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:27,000
application here so three steps first
step is to instantiate I need to go out

127
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,760
adapters. All the adapters go to ask
to the SSL back-end "please give me a

128
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:36,360
topology please
so here represented twp Train Data Service Adapter
and Booking Reference Service Adapter

129
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:44,460
adapter these are like keys to go
outside and to ask stuff, so the first step

130
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:49,980
is access those keys. Then second step
is I've got those keys, I wrapped them
with

131
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:57,330
hexagon, with the domain. the hexagon is
where the domain stay so it's a web ticket manager.

132
01:38:57,330 --> 01:39:01,440
So the web ticket manager
will receive within its console ports

133
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:09,930
interface to interact with the
outside world and then we instantiate we

134
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:14,400
wrapped the hexagon with a new
adapter which will be the adapter to be
used in order to

135
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:22,890
interact with our system so it's "I need to enter" adapters
that it's the way to

136
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:27,660
communicate with our application, but
once we do that all we have to keep in
our hand from an application perspective

137
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:35,070
from the asp.net Web API perspective all
I have to keep in my hand will be the entrypoint adapter

138
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:39,540
so all the rest of the hexagon

139
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:46,590
and adapters it's an implementation
details once I've built the place all I

140
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:51,660
have to keep from our Web API
perspective is that adapter which is the

141
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:58,110
entry point from a formal system. okay? to
put it differently those three steps

142
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:04,199
looking at them in the diagram. First we instantiate
the adapter we need to go out, so

143
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:07,980
the three back ends then we wrap
them with hexagon

144
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:13,440
whereas domain logic stands and then we
wrap that domain logic it's like Russian

145
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:18,000
doll you know I need to go out the hexagon I need to go in and at the end of

146
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,660
the day all you keep in your hands - I
need to go in. This is the only thing

147
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:26,270
that you need to interact with
system from application perspective

148
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:30,960
so all you keep in your line will be
only that adapter that you will inject

149
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:38,489
into your callback I speed up the
corners and stuff like that. okay? sure
you have some question we will call it

150
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:51,440
or hope you will have some questions. so
just to have a look on the new version

151
01:40:51,440 --> 01:41:00,080
you can notice now we have a reservation
and the modification has been to call a

152
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:09,410
confirm because after this line I know
there is no exception and I can return

153
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:16,230
the reservation. so the did, the
modification of the test is there, yeah, we

154
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:23,429
returned a reservation and I already
create a beginning of adapter, the output

155
01:41:23,429 --> 01:41:31,380
adapter with AdaptReservation.
 This function will be called by Thomas in

156
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:35,199
a few minutes, so you start to move
the technical json implementation to the
proper place. exactly. okay. what I suggest

157
01:41:38,469 --> 01:41:44,499
is to for me to to reduce in that first
acceptance test what I will have to do

158
01:41:44,499 --> 01:41:53,229
into my bootstrap my composition route
okay, so first one is to step one is to

159
01:41:53,229 --> 01:41:58,539
instantiate "I want to go out" adapter. so
here trainDataService for instance we
can even rename it to trainDataServicesAdapter.

160
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:05,949
it's a bad name, it's still the
service. that's obviously I was there

161
01:42:05,949 --> 01:42:14,439
it's a proxy too. and same thing for
that bookingReferenceServiceAdapter. okay, step one I instantiate

162
01:42:14,439 --> 01:42:17,349
the dependencies I need to go to the
outside world

163
01:42:17,349 --> 01:42:24,489
yeah? all right, then what I need is to
instantiate the hexagon. actually so the
exact on here is a web ticket manager. so

164
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:35,260
let's call it hexagon only here for
pedagogical school perspective over your

165
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:41,039
life you don't you will call it with a
business name so please don't tell Eric
that we did that but just it's to focus

166
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,999
on the hexagon and infrastructure here.
it's better for me to rename it hexagon

167
01:42:48,999 --> 01:42:53,349
here and then instead of
calling directly the hexagon

168
01:42:53,349 --> 01:42:58,719
all I have said before is the
application we would have to interact

169
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:01,599
with my business logic through an
adapter yeah

170
01:43:01,599 --> 01:43:06,939
so let's introduce it. yeah, step 3
instantiate "I want to go in" adaptor, so

171
01:43:06,939 --> 01:43:13,269
here but I can do is to how can we
generation oh yeah you already

172
01:43:13,269 --> 01:43:20,409
came same name, so I will
instantiate it providing what should I
provide. okay I think I got a sense like

173
01:43:25,059 --> 01:43:30,159
Russian dolls so those two first we are
providing to the hexagon here and the
hexagon is provided to the

174
01:43:32,829 --> 01:43:39,189
guy. okay so I create a constructor
because so far you just had made a

175
01:43:39,189 --> 01:43:44,709
static functions. okay maybe you have to
make that abstraction
not to inject what ticket manager yes

176
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:53,590
actually yes you're right, we talked
about personnel at the ports are like

177
01:43:53,590 --> 01:44:00,429
interfaces so what I can do maybe is on
the web ticket manager here it's

178
01:44:00,429 --> 01:44:06,670
introducing its we changed after so
let's create an interface for that and

179
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:20,170
let's say I reserve seats, something like that? em...
Sorry, I used to work on the Mac,

180
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:25,300
so we try to pick a keyboard
IReserveSeats

181
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:33,039
you work every day on the PC
yes, but not the same keyboard  I tried to find

182
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:44,729
exeucise, stress yeah so I asked I add
the reserve method on that interface.

183
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:49,929
here this is a port this is a port in
order to enter the hexagon

184
01:44:49,929 --> 01:44:56,559
so getting back to the code here
what I will provide to the external

185
01:44:56,559 --> 01:45:04,150
adapter it will be the hexagon but as
oops, go to implementation as charlie
reserved seats yeah IReserveSeat.

186
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:16,150
okay let me keep it into a private field
here I will need it. so I start set a

187
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:22,689
reservation adapter okay so third step to
associate other nationality let's

188
01:45:22,689 --> 01:45:29,469
introduce a variable for that with our
instance okay my idea will be to replace

189
01:45:29,469 --> 01:45:34,959
the direct call to the hexagon by
something going through the adapter you

190
01:45:34,959 --> 01:45:40,539
know. so just to make it compile I will
go to the controller to web controller

191
01:45:40,539 --> 01:45:46,479
which is the place where I will use that
exact same adapter so in that controller

192
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:53,079
here I will need to my entry point will
be together reservation request dto so I
will get a reservation request dto

193
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:59,710
give it to the adapter and the adapter
will get back to me with a Json

194
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:06,590
relating to the reservation okay? so to
do so I think the reservation dto is not

195
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:11,420
in the proper place. I won't be able to
access it from the from the test. So

196
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:16,580
I suggest that we move that and maybe it
will be no envision is quite painful to

197
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:21,830
create project it's long so I will just
create a directory here. I will create

198
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:25,850
Train Train domain all right and
infra

199
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:33,620
so that we can start to split infra
(infrastructure) and so that we
can we are able to speak properly every

200
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:43,190
type into the proper location. I'd moved
typed into matching files for be sure
that every file match to type so

201
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:53,090
BookingReferenceService where should I put
domain or infra

202
01:46:53,090 --> 01:47:02,200
service. it's a bad name, the
name will be different but yeah coach

203
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:11,600
domain yeah IBookingReferenceService
yeah it's an interface so it's a port

204
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:20,570
yeah actually here so domain yeah. IReservedSeats?
port, so the domain, yeah

205
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:29,090
ITrainDataservice, its names but
it's a domain is it okay its interface

206
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:35,860
yeah reservation domain, right?
reserved I shall attempt same
reservation hotel for you , same

207
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:43,820
reservationFailure also it's a
domain.
actually it's much more something to

208
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:49,340
implement the biggest law where there is
no added value more than twelve toppling

209
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:55,430
seats? domain. I'm kind of happy
because you have more domains than the

210
01:47:55,430 --> 01:48:02,740
infrastructur which is not the case in
all my projects so far so SeatJsonPoco

211
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:10,280
SeatsReservationAdapter? infrastructure, yeah

212
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:15,060
ThreadsholdTrainCapacity? domain, absolutely even if we

213
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:24,030
came in through the name. Train? is it
domain and what do we have? TimeDataSservice,
 of course which is another time

214
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:36,450
and WebTicketManager, domain. it's
all exactly but so far it's seen as some

215
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:45,480
to HTTP rationale that we get rid no
it's okay so let's put it to the... let's

216
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:48,230
keep it in the middle

217
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:54,390
let's keep it into the middle before we
completely clean the house and put it in

218
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:57,930
adjust the namespace
sorry I just enhancement yeah I would

219
01:48:57,930 --> 01:49:03,060
adjust the namespace here for the project.
 so that everyone would be at

220
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:16,080
the proper location okay. so what I was
saying is I will from the should TrainTrainShould
getting back to the test

221
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:22,620
okay
I said that I would like to introduce a

222
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:28,680
way to interact with the ReservationAdapter,
 so let's say it's a Post dto.

223
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:34,440
there is a better name to
find but new reservation request
diffuses I don't know if you you move it

224
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:43,530
I don't know I didn't move thanks below
so ReservationRequestDto I

225
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:54,390
have to move is it's on the bad project.
move to folder... TrainTrain infra

226
01:49:54,390 --> 01:50:00,360
so now I will be able to reference it
from the test, otherwise it will be part
of the Web API which has no reference so

227
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:10,290
far okay. so we here I will instantiate a
new reservation request dto. This is ASP.net

228
01:50:10,290 --> 01:50:16,290
which used to instantiate
that for me but our number_of_seats here

229
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:23,530
will be seatsRequestedCount and
the other train_id

230
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:29,890
setting the
equivalent of the Json we receive as

231
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:33,520
the input
it's a poco for it will be

232
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:42,570
TraineId. here is my train
yeah okay so here I post a new
request dto, maybe this thing's, let's

233
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:56,020
make it a variable, to make it clean so I've
got a reservationRequestDto and then I

234
01:50:56,020 --> 01:51:01,240
pass the reservation request to the adapter yeah,
 I want to go into adapter. create method okay create the

235
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:11,200
method and instead of returning void I
will return maybe a string which will be

236
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:17,710
the Json. Here I can
return something much more like asp.net

237
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:21,940
internal structure to make a
response but I won't go into that here

238
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:29,640
but as I rationalize it you okay
so here I am in the posts method yeah

239
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:36,390
that should return me a jsonReservation.
 something like that

240
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:40,390
why not
yeah so the adapter will return me that

241
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:46,260
and I will assert on that yeah so
instead of all that

242
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:51,940
jsonReservation should be equal to
that Json. that objective to target you

243
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:56,740
know that yeah so it's still right
because I didn't plug the adapter. so

244
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:03,160
adapter has three steps to
instantiate the entire hexagon structure

245
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:09,480
but when I mean every method of the
adapter has three steps basically its

246
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:13,440
first step is to adapt from their infrastructure
to the domain

247
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:18,190
second step is to call the business
logic and then the third step is to

248
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:23,800
adapt from domain answer to the
infrastructure and to return it. yeah you

249
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:29,860
know what is it about in every method of
adapter so let's make it here, in that
case I don't have to adapt

250
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:34,679
here so I will just introduce a new
variable

251
01:52:34,679 --> 01:52:40,800
for the number_of_seats and with a
machine liquid in the real life

252
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:47,640
maybe you you have to serialize yourself
and we simulate this tech because asp.net

253
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:53,040
do that for us but sometimes
you have to translate the Json in

254
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:59,820
local variable for a domain object. so here
what I just did is to get some variables

255
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:04,500
but this is where you will have to
translate transform adjust whatever it

256
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:10,110
takes to be able to call the
domain logic. yeah Good. so now I call the

257
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:16,679
hexagon so hexagon.Reserve, it's
a business domain method and I put it

258
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:23,640
to put it local variable I get and numberOfSeats
number of let me call me

259
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:36,900
requested okay I called the hexagon,
its return me reservation, since it is a method a
yeah

260
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:43,710
so has a ration but since it's an async
method I will have to await that and

261
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:49,500
truth sorry some like that c# to
obtain the sequence call. but since your

262
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:54,840
method is I think because it's called
also async method I asked you to do so

263
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:01,020
and then adapt from domain to this is a
method Bruno already done we had adapter

264
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:05,300
adapter damage sure I provide a
reservation and I get some string and

265
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:12,090
yeah I guess, to return. you see I get a
reservation from the business logic and

266
01:54:12,090 --> 01:54:22,230
then what I do is to adapt back from
the domain to the json infrastructure. this
is still red what did I miss

267
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:29,689
[Music]

268
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:44,650
you have to await also because
of a weight this is Mexican Russian okay
it's green sorry it was async/await

269
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:52,780
issue. that's time to implement in SSP
net. so here as you can see within one
acceptance test we have done what we

270
01:54:54,460 --> 01:54:59,530
have to do is in composition note of the
application I don't know what you want

271
01:54:59,530 --> 01:55:08,650
to do, well, we have less than 10 minutes
I think what that parts should be the one

272
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:13,000
that we will put into the setup of the
application so I can do that plug into

273
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,370
the webosphere but maybe it's better to
keep some time for questions or for kind

274
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,969
of wrap up, what do you think? okay
yeah otherwise I think I will have to

275
01:55:21,969 --> 01:55:35,320
run because we kind of little bit late
yeah so wrap up, we started from

276
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:42,130
situation like this we have a web ticket
manager with a very procedural code do

277
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:48,450
this and after we lead to some more

278
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:56,370
consistent and more, I don't know what to
say, short working code also

279
01:55:56,370 --> 01:56:02,800
after Reserve method was kind of something
like this. thing is yes pretty much what

280
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:09,489
we achieved what's important is that we
embrace the language of our domain
within our code plus legacy code very

281
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:17,469
crappy and when we if we had time to
executor and append

282
01:56:17,469 --> 01:56:25,050
we will have less warnings we just you
know in second just just in front yeah

283
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:30,160
so we are talking
about reservations, trains reception

284
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:35,710
at term present which is fulfilled you
see so much, even if our domain experts

285
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:42,469
is not able to read our code we can read
in front of him and

286
01:56:42,469 --> 01:56:49,070
being, yeah, being able to have a
discussion and he's being able to say no

287
01:56:49,070 --> 01:56:54,340
no this is not what I want for that
system. so there is less

288
01:56:54,340 --> 01:57:00,199
friction there is less gaps between what
we implemented what we was talking about.
so it's better if you want to follow him

289
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:11,810
yeah we had some called ndependent show it in
a few seconds, but just before that

290
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:19,310
yeah that's because it takes time to
switch as a final wrap-up we did not

291
01:57:19,310 --> 01:57:23,810
have to time to to make you feel that
because automate expertise in Paris and

292
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:29,120
our first version was with him on stage
but it's crucial to talk to your domain
experts yeah most of the project has

293
01:57:31,429 --> 01:57:36,710
issue because the developers are not even
allowed to talk to domain experts.

294
01:57:36,710 --> 01:57:41,239
so for me so no it's a no-go I finish I
decide not to go to the project if it's
like this, but it wasn't the case at the

295
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:50,300
beginning of my career so takes yes it
takes courage time determination to

296
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:58,120
enforce that. but it's crucial otherwise
yeah not as if they don't buy the legacy

297
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:04,610
because I'm a coach and I learn how to
refactor the code generate people when

298
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:09,560
there is dependencies said my code is
not testable actually we can test any

299
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:16,820
code any code so don't be daunted by it
I guess you may have some gut to do so yeah it
cost I but it's doable yeah and also

300
01:58:21,530 --> 01:58:27,080
it's we don't use a lot of techniques
here we basically use two basic

301
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:30,260
techniques from the refactoring book of
Martin Fowler

302
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:35,780
it's extract and move methods so it's
pretty much simple as soon as you have a
test Alice which is the first steps you

303
01:58:38,199 --> 01:58:44,739
can extract and move very very easily
the more complicated is to find some

304
01:58:44,739 --> 01:58:53,640
proper semantics and to and to invest in
your domain design they we have great

305
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:57,930
in track of improvement as you just said
by some of you. yes this is something

306
01:58:57,930 --> 01:59:05,730
that is a living and ensuring you have
yeah you have been very interactive user
so thank you very much

307
01:59:07,190 --> 01:59:12,340
