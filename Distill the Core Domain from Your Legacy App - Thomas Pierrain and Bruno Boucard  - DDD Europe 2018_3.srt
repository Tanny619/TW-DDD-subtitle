1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,536
we will do that in a circle

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:06,400
but before that we would like to introduce the missing concept 

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
because

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,240
when we enter BuildReservationAttempt here 

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,336
we build it from the 

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,944
train perspective and not from the coach perspective

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,016
we use orders with no notion of coach 

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,136
So how to introduce the concept of coach according to you what will be yours

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,464
From the website

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
Hugo Webster

11
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,104
Best kinesiology is

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
Basiclly the topology is taken from the name of average everything name including a1 a2 a3 b4...

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,112
A is the name of the coach

14
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,160
it's an implict where I'll figure it out these seats belongs to the coach

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
Lyrics to the Good Ship

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,328
yeah absolutely..good idea

17
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,912
but how to introduce it 

18
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
right now

19
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,240
what will be your next move? 

20
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:22,688
yeah okay, but how to do that? 

21
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
start by what you suggested if you have a keyboard

22
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Yeah

23
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,280
Why not? But we will start with a widget test...absolutely...

24
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,864
from the train we will get ...

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
we will check that the a train exposed coaches

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
 for instance 

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Because we totally addictive

28
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
TDD

29
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
And

30
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
we want you 

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
To create so let's add a trend...should...fixture...

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
But so far we don't...we only have some  acceptance tests

33
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,440
32 total system should do

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Do they do that do it so we have three tests

35
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12,608
And it will be our first unit test I would say

36
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
It's a time? should

37
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
And maybe should expose coaches something like that? 

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
So we get a train

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
so should trend show the expose coaches? 

40
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Everyone is fine because I don't know

41
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
Should expose coaches

42
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
....coaches

43
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
so...yeah...

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
he talked a lot about it...yeah...yeah...yeah

45
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,896
Actually here I had even in mind some new rules for the related to the coach even he first to fix by then

46
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
But

47
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
Because money 

48
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
But he has some inline to consolidate and to a new business rules

49
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Such as

50
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
We should not

51
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:13,024
Feed a coach more than 40%

52
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
for instance

53
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,912
and step like so it we need the population through to make it

54
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
So Far we need it 

55
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,296
We need to play with the coach

56
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,856
We need to ask it...to ask it

57
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
that's yes

58
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
If you want to keep it completely private implementation details for your detail capsulated

59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
we won't write that

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
So just for

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
some explanation because I use a 

62
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
A snake

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,288
Name because we

64
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:02,688
We use it in the tests to mark some situations this is a tenth topology table

65
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
so he will probably have built a spawning...a way to qualify the topology 

66
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:14,976
And it's good to use because I know in this topology 

67
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
I have to coach and 

68
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,328
Stand sit for each coach so it's the reason why I use this one 

69
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,912
You in your test associated a train

70
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:25,984
Ok providing in the Train

71
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:28,800
The list of seats adapted from that train

72
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:30,336
topology

73
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:31,104
Ok

74
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:32,896
So let's check

75
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,712
train...coaches...

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,248
Yeah I'm sorry

77
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:40,064
And

78
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:43,136
I hate coaches but it doesn't exist at this time

79
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,464
We need to

80
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:49,280
A size of

81
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,608
two...because they have two coaches from the topology

82
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:59,264
And you can also check that every coach has 10 seats maybe

83
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:07,200
It is long because I think it to be like a dictionary for half hour break....coaches["A"], coaches["B"]

84
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:09,760
Coaches["A"]

85
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,576
the seats...dot seats

86
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:14,880
A size 10

87
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:17,184
Because every coach...ya

88
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,488
Ok just to

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,608
Just to make it expose what we	have with in trend topology...okay...

90
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:27,168
So it's start to generate something

91
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:28,960
Ok

92
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:32,544
So you said the dictionary

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,128
Name

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,968
Coach

95
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:42,272
doesn't exists yet

96
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:45,088
The same we will create 

97
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:45,856
type

98
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,672
for Coach...Yeah I would create it because right time

99
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,792
So here the train will have 

100
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:55,840
A list of coach

101
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:57,632
And now I can

102
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,680
start as a dictionary

103
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,384
If we have more time we won't expose it as a dictionary also we expose that a read-only dictionary

104
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,944
or even better a concept

105
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:13,760
The delegate type for that but

106
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:17,856
Since I would like to show you a lot of other stuff we want

107
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:20,672
right here but

108
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:22,464
To loop on the seats

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,048
So here in within the concept D I G would be

110
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:31,424
would be ok I've got a list of we said that the name of coach was an implict

111
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:34,752
information passed of the name of every seats

112
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,104
So for every seat we just have to check if there is a coach

113
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,128
With that name

114
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,200
Because seats has a capacity coach named

115
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:47,296
And if we don't have an entry in the dictionary yet from that

116
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,344
Coach name let's

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,112
add it

118
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:51,392
to the dictionary

119
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:54,976
Sorry

120
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:05,216
Yes we can use an link...yeah. you have a query on seats for the beginning of algorithm I prefer to show without thinking

121
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:07,776
And

122
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:13,920
by use to set a new coach...we also set a new coach...and providing info name...set the coach name maybe

123
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:17,760
So

124
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:24,416
we iterate on every seats of the trainer for every one of theme

125
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:29,536
we added the relating coach into the dictionary on the fly

126
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,328
Then we have to

127
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,352
add the seats

128
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:36,448
so...coach name

129
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,384
First step second step is to add the seat into the coach

130
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,736
......

131
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:51,296
......okay

132
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:52,320
seat dot coach name maybe

133
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:54,368
Goodnight idiot

134
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:55,648
I introduced available

135
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
we called it..can you coach?

136
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:02,816
Yes

137
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:04,352
Ok...why not

138
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:08,192
new coach

139
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,472
add...seat...

140
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:18,688
Are you doing that for to expose the kind of ? for a person but you want to make it work and then we can refactor something like that

141
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:22,272
It is correct not ok

142
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:28,928
No

143
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,024
Ok. Ok

144
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,072
actually you have to ......I have to instance at first 

145
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:41,472
the coache is here 

146
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:44,288
coach..coach....coach...and on that coach..you had the seats

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,312
So

148
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,408
So I had to

149
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:52,480
I suppose I have kind of list of seats

150
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,552
So you are

151
00:08:56,064 --> 00:09:00,928
What glue do you use to make USB data switch for handling unit

152
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:01,952
we will need to make a coach

153
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:09,376
A nice place to to find our list of assets I would say

154
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:11,680
But

155
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:12,704
There is

156
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,520
something that bother me a little bit  in here. But

157
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:16,800
I'll let you finish

158
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,360
I've got to see greener

159
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:22,432
The greener

160
00:09:27,552 --> 00:09:30,624
I see

161
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:36,000
just complain

162
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:37,792
What's yours

163
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,704
Alton Towers

164
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:48,800
Mahir

165
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,336
here...should be green

166
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:58,272
I don't really like that kind of

167
00:09:58,784 --> 00:09:59,296
We

168
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,136
Add a seats to a coach...we change the coach

169
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,416
Actually

170
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:05,952
If you have more time

171
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,000
There is something I would like to do

172
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:12,864
It's even to make it everything immutable

173
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:15,680
Because what we do is

174
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:21,056
basically with when you reserve...we want to reserve	some seats, we get trand apology

175
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:23,360
Which is something that we don't own

176
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:25,152
It's coming from the outside world

177
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:26,432
We work on it

178
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:32,576
And I really don't want us to be tempted somehow to keep it in cash

179
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:34,368
because it will be stupid

180
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:41,280
And I would like to offer the fact that's when we get a trent apology it should be immutable all I can do is to work with

181
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:45,120
To find some information or to build reservation attempt

182
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,680
But I don't want to allow my mates

183
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:51,264
are new joiners in the team...it start

184
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,128
to...to...break that by introducing a cache and a state well

185
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:57,152
I don't want

186
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:57,920
to be

187
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:04,320
So if we had more time when I would like to do is to make your everything immutable, the train will be immutable,the coaches will be

188
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,112
immutable and the seats also

189
00:11:06,368 --> 00:11:08,160
the only

190
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,232
things that will be mutable is the reservation attempt 

191
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:17,632
you see the a formal reservation attempt which will be kind of entity that has a life cycle and $%^&?

192
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:21,472
But the time changed all over the time

193
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:25,312
At the end I will transform the reservation attemp to reservation

194
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,360
And the reseravation would be immutable

195
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:30,432
Otherwise shown is Harrison we it's

196
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,224
yeah, you have question?

197
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,304
Sorry?...Absolutely....is of reasoning....if we

198
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
get back to the

199
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:49,376
addseats

200
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:54,496
What would like is to maybe to one for sense it's to use what we call a closure of operation

201
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:56,288
its meaning the coach

202
00:11:56,544 --> 00:12:00,128
We have a method which is addSeats so I can add seats for the coache 

203
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:03,712
But instead of mutating me the coache installs

204
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:06,784
What we would like is to for that guy to reach on me

205
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:08,576
The New Coach

206
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:10,112
a new aston soccer coach

207
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:10,880
So

208
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:14,464
I called method...add seats on a coach

209
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:18,304
All it can do is to return your new sorts

210
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,096
With that seats involved

211
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:26,240
But without changing the previous instance here that when I call the addSeats

212
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,008
Listen

213
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,544
So

214
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,408
The benefits is the first time with ability	for of course or for passion but also reduce the grouping

215
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:36,736
It's easier to move to move code

216
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:38,272
Here the coach

217
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:40,064
stand by itself somehow

218
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,416
you know...method on the coach which are mean the source of coach

219
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:51,072
For if I want to move that it's more easy than if the coach where related to a new type which is releated to a new types and step like that

220
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:52,608
and step like that.

221
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,656
for everyone

222
00:12:55,168 --> 00:12:55,936
Ok yeah

223
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:16,928
In any case it's important to discuss with theme

224
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:19,232
unfortunately we used to do that session with one domain expert 

225
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:20,512
on stage with us

226
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,560
and we asked some questions since he's not here we know a lot of stuff

227
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:24,864
so there is a lot of implict you know in our head

228
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,704
But yes you're right you should have some kind of discussion

229
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,496
But

230
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:37,408
Here is much more an implementation detail I would say

231
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:40,480
It's to all folks the fact that I no want to talk any kind of

232
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:44,064
states relating to something that I don't

233
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm not  

234
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:49,440
owner of the topology of the train I'm just a user

235
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:53,024
and every time a request is it getting back to me

236
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,584
Get a snapshot walk over snapshots

237
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:59,168
through my concept of the man and then make a reservation

238
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,472
So

239
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:20,160
Yeah, absolutely

240
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:27,328
Ok I think maybe not pop up...okay, let's turn it to instead of changing the coach here 

241
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:29,888
let's switch a new sort of instance

242
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:32,704
make it a coach of attention here

243
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,616
So I didn't seats it doesn't mutate the existing coach which will only return 

244
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:40,640
a coach installs

245
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:43,968
Coach

246
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,248
Ok

247
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:46,272
with seat name

248
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:49,344
with what? 

249
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:50,624
With a list

250
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,392
a new list?

251
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,208
yeah

252
00:14:54,464 --> 00:15:00,608
Acutally session is best from a session of three hours we have made in Paris ^&*()?

253
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:04,960
expect outstage our left floor forward

254
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:11,360
I guess museum story with tons of stuff so 

255
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:14,944
we had to pick a fight for that short version of two hours... there are many things that we may improve

256
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:21,856
So we can't fault that the coach ships a train seats our really value types

257
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:22,880
So we would

258
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:27,488
go into that we will only make that coach immutable

259
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:30,304
Maybe

260
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:34,400
There's lots of things to me to improve...and respect the

261
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,448
producing a sure

262
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:39,520
Yes

263
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:41,312
to avoid the 

264
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:43,616
The big issue

265
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:48,224
to implement the same constructor as before ok

266
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:51,040
So now I have to fix it

267
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:52,064
the code

268
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,088
Yeah

269
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:01,792
we could existing code

270
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:02,816
was doing that

271
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:04,352
so maybe steps you know

272
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:09,472
you should call this..

273
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:15,104
So time to change it and to...so

274
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,896
So will be to get the coach

275
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,176
To add seats

276
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:19,968
So

277
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:21,248
through it...new coach

278
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:24,320
Yeah, new coach and then to stalk the new coach by 

279
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,880
a ball into dictionary

280
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:30,976
So it's still red here? 

281
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:35,328
But I guess that after saving that new coach value

282
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,888
Into the dictionary it will be green again

283
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:39,424
Fully?

284
00:16:41,728 --> 00:16:42,240
That's right

285
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,032
Inevitable

286
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:04,512
Yeah yeah

287
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:13,216
It was in the test

288
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,312
and the coach

289
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:25,248
Yeah

290
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:28,320
Unless you get back to the unit test again

291
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,560
Oh yes you're right

292
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,352
completely

293
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,384
we will do that because we would like to show you a picture second architecture and lots of other stuff...but yes you're right...you're right

294
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:02,880
Yeah but absolutely that was next point actually we have a train which has 

295
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,184
exposed a list of seats and trying to expose the list of coach

296
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,536
Because all seats belong to the coaches so what we should do is

297
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:13,376
Instead of adding duplicates collection on the train

298
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:15,424
instead to have a projection

299
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:18,240
And the list of seats for the train must be the

300
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:21,312
The projection of all the seats of every coach

301
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:21,568
of the train

302
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:22,592
so let's do that

303
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:25,920
select mini something like that

304
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:27,712
coaches

305
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:30,016
let's take every coach

306
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:33,088
And return the value

307
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,624
select many coach

308
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:41,024
dot seats

309
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:43,328
change to c 

310
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:44,352
I just see

311
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:45,120
better

312
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:49,728
toList

313
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,752
newList

314
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,384
this kind of linked you again better so we met a projection

315
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,408
we take

316
00:18:57,664 --> 00:18:59,456
All the seats on every coach

317
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:02,784
And we return it at the this that's it for the entire train

318
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:06,880
So we have this one? we don't need to set it anymore because it will be

319
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:07,905
a get on me

320
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:13,025
Ok

321
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,913
We need we have the coach...compiled

322
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,705
Yeah it's good now

323
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:25,313
So maybe we can maybe we can fix the bug

324
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:26,337
What do you think

325
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:28,897
Ok

326
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,249
Absolutely villages yes

327
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,577
idea is to move the findAvailableSeats or the buildReservationAttempt 

328
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,857
to the coach level

329
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:40,161
Because if we asked to the train level

330
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,977
There is no way of

331
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:46,817
properly there is a way that kind of crappy

332
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:48,097
so let's delegated it

333
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,169
To the to The Coach so I'm removing

334
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:51,937
This one

335
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:55,265
So we only do this test it will be red and red

336
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:56,801
green step

337
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:02,433
So it's come back to the web ticket

338
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:06,017
and as you suggested

339
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:07,809
Maybe the

340
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:11,649
buildReservationAttempt is in charge to be verified

341
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,489
and to tweet

342
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,025
Something new

343
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:23,425
Maybe we can change the algorithm

344
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:24,705
but respect

345
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:26,753
so I go submit based on the coach

346
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:30,337
Let's put that

347
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:32,897
logic of looking at cheat sheets

348
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:34,177
at coach level

349
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:37,249
So Far Away every coach

350
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:43,393
So we will have you maybe the same thing build a reservation attempt...yeah...I would like to use this one

351
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:45,697
please coach

352
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,257
beat me build reservation attemp if you can

353
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:49,537
Ok

354
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:55,681
And returning you a reservcation attempt

355
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:58,241
ReservcationAttempt

356
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:00,289
Is reservationAttempt

357
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,313
Adele

358
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:08,481
And if...reservation attempt

359
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:09,761
IsFulfilled

360
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:10,529
Ok

361
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:13,089
Then return

362
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,649
reservationAttempt

363
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:20,513
If not, we continue to iterate it on the next coach ask to the same thing once we have

364
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,049
at least one coach

365
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:25,633
Proventia us its fulfill another reservation attempt we are happy with that

366
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:26,913
So

367
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,753
This one is actually the code I would like to

368
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:33,057
Compliment get pasted

369
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:34,593
In

370
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:38,433
So let's create a method

371
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,369
Okay, and I don't like copy and paste actually

372
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:49,697
but in that case it

373
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:52,769
So justified

374
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:59,169
it's green....so we just fix the bug by doing that...maybe you can a red green refactor

375
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:04,801
Something to refact buildReservationAttempt to the train level

376
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:08,129
we still...let some code

377
00:22:08,385 --> 00:22:08,897
So

378
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,225
based on the  what's on 'what'

379
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:14,785
here we have some kind of 

380
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:20,673
...copy code so let's replace it with a link you request

381
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:26,305
So take me please all seats where booking list is empty

382
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:29,121
is empty...string dot is null or empty

383
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:36,033
if we create a method of yeah...yeah...and

384
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:40,897
take this number of request

385
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,457
So here we are projecting a list of

386
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:44,993
Seats

387
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:51,137
That are available and then we have a list of seats and available seats and then we take

388
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:57,793
The first three four whatever number we asked and I replace this one...it does

389
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:01,377
Exactly the same thing of the foreach loop we have seats here

390
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:05,217
To prove it you just have to

391
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,777
you have to...just to...get all of them

392
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:12,385
I remove

393
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:14,177
Ok

394
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,761
Ok you remove it

395
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,065
Here

396
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,137
Oops

397
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:24,673
I made a mistake

398
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:25,697
Now it's ok

399
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:32,097
So what we can do maybe seems we try to missed up anything to attract mosquitoes

400
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:37,217
things so here is quite difficult with

401
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,081
Inshallah ok

402
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:51,297
The semester we should be

403
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:52,577
it's available

404
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:54,881
Since we are working on seats

405
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,441
so non-static public 

406
00:23:58,721 --> 00:23:59,489
And we will

407
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:03,841
extract method and then we will move it into the seats and the seats level

408
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:04,609
So

409
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:05,889
Move it

410
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:10,753
So here now if you can zoom on the link us with a request 

411
00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:15,361
light on the seats and we take all the seats that are available

412
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,945
And we take the first number that we need it

413
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:30,209
We need it. That's we introduced that eariler for the each fulfilled 

414
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:36,353
for another I should attempt 

415
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,913
to be able to say fulfilled obtain a good reservation it's design choice...yeah...

416
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:40,961
Ok

417
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:43,777
We happy because then we could go back

418
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:49,409
fix bug you can imporving a little bit in the garden....yeah...
