1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,048
Maybe we can have a

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,096
Tiny

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,656
Punto abarth Aggregates

00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:13,056
Daughter just a tiny fight about aggregates aggregates a collection of objects without wanted to know why you tired

5

AstraZeneca Central Hall

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,176

Is Gorton aggregate

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Why is that

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,656
And does not seem to know because aggregates in science

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,984
When do the schools need to 22222

12
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,520
Tamiya

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:50,176
Ed Sheeran the only running value for harvesting data training

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,632
When we discussed with the ministry after you told her that you wanted to have some new rules ready to the coach

18
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:14,752
So that's a good enough money for funeral so I must not be here

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,080
The giving diversity is going to change maternity

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:22,432
Leggetts voice maybe it's getting better

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,992
Something interesting

22
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,320
Train coaches and seatbelt devalue types here

23
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
As we discussed earlier

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,976
If you think about the way we interact with external backend

25
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
You're the kind of snapshots

26
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,328
Venice, moment of time

27
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,144
In we will rock on that Snapchat song

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
With a wall to keep it in cash we just want to rock with all those Aggregates

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Francis

30
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
So24 that we can make it all when you type so I shouldn't International

31
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
That's what we did

32
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,136
So that means that some aggregates may be completely when you type so so

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
The train here

34
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
It's most of the cases leggings with each other

35
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,192
Do it was 11 days where we could have

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Just exception

37
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
If you have a number you're just going to be interested because

38
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
Maternity orangutan letter in the longest run without me do that

39
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328

I think we have gone off

44
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Improve the little bit 61 screen hi it's using the world's of the domain was in the car

45
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
Don't recall lyrics Justin

Rifftrax and some of the other new we put it into the popular locations

47
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
But there is still something

48
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
Weather

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
Tomorrow started

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
The swap

51
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
This is that we have some Jesus

52
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,912

53
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
The main method

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,056
Respiratory telescope strings is also ageism

55
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:30,688
What we would like to do here is to get rid of that designs train stuff

56
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:36,320
Attributed by your husband

57
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,416
That's all that's ok that my son will return a reservation

58
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
And then

59
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
On the positive side

Gaza

65
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
You don't seem that it will explain when we get back to the code

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,232
So who is the weather for today

67
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Ok good

68
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:23,424
What is it going to hospital is it secure pattern made by Alistair Cockburn

69
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:28,800
I called him another day

70
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:32,128
And it has many benefits

71
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:34,688
Patel Natasha teacher 11

00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:43,648
Plug and unplug

75
00:04:43,904 --> 00:04:45,952
External dependencies plugin and play store

76
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,024
Just talking about the weather system

77
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:55,168
Ableton tuner plug with many different standards as important many different

78
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,704

Broadcast news to broadcast to TV to radio to whatever

80
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:04,128
So it was Israel and us to have a

81
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,688
Kenneth clean code inside and

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,064
Every changes in terms of 400 or way to interact with the system

83
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,952
Premier tournaments 2017 he knew you play your pregnant and you went back up again and that's it

84
00:05:18,464 --> 00:05:23,840
Sorry it's come with us was introduced by that I didn't mind

85
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:27,168
That's when we think about it babe

86
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:31,520
I notice that we want to Foster on the domain to make some Cudmore

87
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:33,824
Volume dealers value inside

88
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,104
Power products

89
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,688
Doing good, technical stuff

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
I don't know for you but

91
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:47,136
Very long time I thought it was not even possible to popular speed between domain music and and technical one week

92
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:48,416
We tried many times.

93
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:52,768
Refers to lots and in since I discovered that that Patel

94
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:55,328
It's really nice way to inform that

95
00:05:56,608 --> 00:06:02,752
I also do you want Foster 72 because everything is a pluggable which unlocked

96
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:06,592
Toaster input output of the systems

97
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:08,896
This week's inside in

98
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:12,736
So what you doing for Christmas morning how to put it on the mountain

99
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,784
How does it work

100
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:17,600
It was considering the world into

101
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:18,880
Different area

102
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,928
There is a inside and there is no type

103
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,208
Sybarite

104
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,232
No

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,816
So the lovely girls know something to area

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,984
The insiders of the main it showed unemployed like it I like the train station attendant

107
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,752
The stuff like that

108
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,800
Is it possible to code is at

109
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:39,872
The outside of show off your system

110
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:43,200
So this is where you will find your favourite HTTP start

111
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:49,600
No that his rivals your message oriented middleware every solution what it is it is in cottage cheese

112
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:56,000
And what we want is to Foster and to improve the Dominican

113
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:57,536
So we have

114
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:02,400
How do you know National Insurance sometimes about putting some bum boils around your bum and blood

115
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:03,680
N

116
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,984
Defining some entry points

117
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,568
29 to 20 centimetres

118
00:07:09,824 --> 00:07:10,592
Funny clip

119
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,152
The Apostle shop good idea sign

120
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,344
Nice community actually because I don't know for you better when you start your stereos Liverpool

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,904
You need to improve your skin you need to discover new sink

122
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,952
Need to meet new lot of mistakes

123
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,000
Newton Village Hall Kinross unit

124
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:34,912
Ul.to to realise at one point that there are some serious stuff like influence you all time rock stuff like that

125
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:38,752
But before you focus on the on the Dunham really

126
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:43,360
Experian Boston for some new jungle ability to be able to

127
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,152
To play in the care of playground

128
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:47,200
I'm ok with that

129
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,760
As much as it does not geopandas

130
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:54,624
The biggest value in the project and in that case I'm happy with that because there is kind of

131
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,952
Location where you can play It's a playground South Hospital

132
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:02,560
Try new technology new stuff that are members of Japan is England

133
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:03,840
101

134
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,400
I really like you letter is a pattern

135
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:13,312
So how do you drop because they are ok but I need to

136
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:14,592
Dementia

137
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:18,688
To do so in terms of dependencies all dependencies afterwards inside

138
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,760
Leeds away restaurants

139
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,600
But of course I do we could not be aware that alright

140
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:27,136
Any homework

141
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:32,256
Avengers on stuff if you like that's all the domain is completely

142
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:39,680
Independent from any kind of technology even g-strings

143
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:43,008
So to do so tomorrow to S2

144
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:45,568
Wolf from the Inside to the outside to ask

145
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,664
New sing to talk with external web apis and do some stuff

146
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:52,480
We will rely on personalities

147
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,784
Lucifer

148
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:58,368
We actually use the dependency inversion principle

149
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,720
For that funding so we can go outside and do some stuff

150
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:09,632
How do you stop a building and recently his test results remember the name and that was

151
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:10,912
Suggesting the name of

152
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:12,448
Configurable dependencies

153
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:18,848
Weather is the worst thing is impossible possible I don't really like because this is like you

154
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,920
Negative way of formulating Sainsbury's

155
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:23,712
You used to do that

156
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:26,272
Do the other way round do the inverse

157
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,928
Sorry was trying to find them much more fluent intention way of saying that

158
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:35,744
So they lead us to a configurable dependencies

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,304
So you plug in and plug in your dependencies

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,632
Randy alderman

161
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:48,544
So if we get back to where we Ascend we have posted another talk to enter

162
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,848
I believe the video man

163
00:09:51,104 --> 00:09:51,872
The box

Prostitutes will talk to you about the composition without your application you know

203
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:17,280
The place on the opportunity where you get all your dependencies

204
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:23,168
And then follow a player leave the system is able to work continues his way

205
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,472
So we're talking about.

So first one is to step 1

279
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,000
List all instances I want to go out adaptor so here

Adaptor

287
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:16,640
Ok

288
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:22,016
Step one instance of the dependencies I need to go to the outside world

289
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,600
Then what I need is to associate

290
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,904
Zigzag

291
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,464
So the attack on here is a web ticket manager

292
00:16:30,976 --> 00:16:31,488
So let's

293
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:33,024

Weather for ME2 397 hair

300
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:57,344
And then instead of going directly the lagoon

301
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:04,256
All I said before is the application would have to interact with my biometrics

302
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:06,560
IPhone adaptor so let's introduce it

303
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:08,608
Supreme

304
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:11,424
Interested I want to go in adaptor so here

305
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,496
I can do is to what how can we then use it

306
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,992
Providing what should I provide

307
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:30,112

From chance ok

311
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:50,848
Maybe you have to make an attraction and not to inject the web

312
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:51,616
Ticket manager

313

315
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:03,648
Maybe is on the web ticket manager here

316
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,304
This information can write and we will change after so let's create an interface for that

317
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,584
Adana CI

318
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:16,192
