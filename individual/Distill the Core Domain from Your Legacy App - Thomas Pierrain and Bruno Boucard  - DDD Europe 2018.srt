127
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295

131
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,935
Podcast after calls because they trace recruit spinners

132
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,311

Every call

135
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,759
You made on Lozells back-end duper she's so that means that stuff to talk or Stockton

136
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:55,647
Every time you call one of those web API is child from

137
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439

138
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
To do so badly

139
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
Think they are being too much

140
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
So they asked us to have a look at the code

141
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Everything

142
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,447
What measures reasoning and continuous troubleshooting and fix

143
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
If you have something to fix

Risotto

159
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
Because I apply the rule

So 7577 sitting exactly

161

346
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
We are not allowed to wear off

347
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Including it

348
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Because

349
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,463
Since we don't have any tennis courts near

350
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,559
New Year cottages for large two finger burger would be true to make it

Menu for that it's been

353
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
There's so much crap in things like that

354
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
So let's clean

355
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
Ruskin College

359
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,527
Is the first phases when you discover a cold

360
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,367
Because you need to be more coffee than before

361
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,208
To apply idp factoring

362
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,280
It's a way to discover 6

363
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,840
A little Wing

364
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
Name of the viable spies on tour

365
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
And after

366
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:34,336
Get into the proper way to improve our mental model

367
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
Between you don't come back from the beginning

368
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
Train to improve a little bit

369
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Yeah but before that

370
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,024
1st April on 63

371
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
But you noticed something wrong with you.

372
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
It's rather

373
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
Is difficult to

374
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:05,568
The coffee that is like cold or is right because it's another

375
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
A mistake

376
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,176
I don't see the mistake I prefer things to see Green

377
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Might also

378
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
You do that

379
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,600
Will it completely in your that tested it in the bag

380
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
It's a good technique

381
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,720
If you're in the same situation when this feeling

382
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,304
You need to recycle just before hitting the bag

383
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,400
You know that's destiny searching the baby

384
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
So that it's green you have a test harness to a factor and then you enable back

385
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
So

386
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
This is what

387
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
You're doing a white

388
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:46,784
Invoice meaning

389
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Create

390
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Current behavior

391
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
When your refactoring

392
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
Maintaining the current behaviour

393
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,568
So by creating a new test

394
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Tesco current behaviour

395
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,552
Yes I like a lot which is a golden master

396
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
Columbus oh to take a legacy code

397
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,136

398
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:27,232
Nuro to write acceptance test

399
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
Every time I send that important to the Legacy code and the newest ostriches I will walk

400
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Rockingham

401
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,216
I must I'm expecting to see the same output

402
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,264
On both instances

403
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
So that result

404
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
Even understanding Gillingham

405
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
I can't have just done this

406
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:50,528
Making me and forcing me do I don't break any existing video

407
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
Thought this is a strategy that we could have done better here we are watching TV

408
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,976
Beautiful as an unexpected

409
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:05,632
So we stick to that event for an agency

410

423
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104

424
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040

The trend on deserts of the British weather

679
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
So we call it that

680

Identification

681
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,352
But

682
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,192

So we don't have any kind of references from the train to when you can off

689
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,256
Trend of Us army soldier

690

So that's

691
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,072
So

692
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352

We have some ok but we ask the train we get

698
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:57,344

Harry Potter July doing all the magic

740
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
What I suggest

741
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
Surely it's too

742
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,007
Production Gear Jordan to put it in the population in Tritton Leicester or child objects

743

748
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:45,535
Has be classed as a Wimpy Kid furniture offers on the sofa instance and the Crosby's Alexa.

749
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,375
So what'll we do a lot it's to extract credit

750
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
Please type the behavior

751
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:55,519
Into a method so then you will have a method into the same type

752
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,871
And then we will move it into the population in the train France

753
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:04,223
At the end of the day would have more actually rating

00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:09,599
New Balance

755

We will do that

758
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,815
Ok

759
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:25,727
This train reserve seats personal analysis the first Middle School attendance should not

760
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
Maximum capacity of the train

761
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,335
I suggested recycle message here

762
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:37,247
But maybe does not it does not exceed does not exceed

763
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
Overall

764
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Friends episode in concert

765
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647

Diversity

769
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:54,399
I will make us a non static method and primaquine to be able to move it

770
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
Isn't it

771
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:00,799
So here I strike that two minutes with that method

772
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
Where should I

773
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,383
Move it

774
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:05,919
Going to

775
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,991
The training and everything

776
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,783
If I said

777
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
6 tomorrow

778
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
Azure Python passing arguments to an instance of an argument so you can easily move that day

779
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,095
Trainer has a train does not exceed over altering capacity

780
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,679
If I want to replace number of seats

781
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Ok

782
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,103
Actually what we have here is available seats

783
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:40,479
Real building list of available seats at School of Massage Windsor

784
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,271

Turn on statistics on solar movies

789
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
So here

790
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:58,911
If the train does not exceed if I request does not exceed the maximum capacity

791
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,959
Where to find sum of elements

792
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
Actually

793
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,383
They said that we may introduce here instead of that

794
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
When you finish

795
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431

796
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247

Allocation

798
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
A specification

799
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
Yes

800
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,863
Yeah except of course at the end of the day we will need to try 1800 Portsmouth

801
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,471
Before that's the don't expect was talking a lot about whether I should attend

802
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,543
Set a rear bottom cassette for fine

803
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,103
So I think it's so sweet

804
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,431
Instead of just dealing with available seats a list of Sith

805
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:45,247
There's a vendor distance of possession from that

806
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271

00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:05,215
Some people know in Japan

811
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:11,359
It's a tool to check the dependencies that it exists the architect for Java

812
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,663

819
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
Scorpio card should rely on your ability language and we see we have some problem and

820
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,303
As you can see we have the list of program and the world not matching correctly

821
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,863
Letters of a gamma camera

822
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,911
We have to

823
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:13,567
Enter a list of words that are part of Oldham in Lancashire

824
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:19,967

00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:52,479
Ok so let's get back to to the business we have a solicitor

831
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
Available seats

832

958
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,439

Attack the messenger

960
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:31,327

The process is to build a reservation agent

978
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:33,023
And at the end of the day to transform it into hibernation

979
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,863
So yes but I wasn't saying that

980
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,447

990
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,383
Then we clear it interesting

991

995
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,303

01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,111
Tried as additionally.

1165
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:14,815
From what time we want sex but it doesn't show your story which was it arranged a really nice area

1166
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,375
What even better a concept

1167
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,191
The dedicated type or not

1168
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:24,287
Material would like to show you a lot of other stuff we want

1169
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,103

Tulip and stator

1171
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:32,479
So here we had a cup of tea and will be

1172
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:37,855

Information passed of the name of every city

1174
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,535
So for every since we just have to check if there is a coach

1175
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,559
With that name

1176
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,631
Because she doesn't want us to go today

1177
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:53,727
And if we don't have an entry in the dictionary yet from that

1178
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,775

01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:35,967
Add the running coach into the dictionary on the fly

1188

So I had to

1211
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,911

1215
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:15,807

01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
Red

1217
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,135

1220
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,791
I've got a cigarette

I don't really like that channel

1229
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
We

1230
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,567
Add a section to a coach should we change the coach

1231
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,847
Actually

1232
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
If you have more time

1233
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,431
There is something I would like to do

1234
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,295
It's even to make it everything imageable

1235
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,111
Because what we do is

1236
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:27,487
Will you get me when was Elvis when was Theresa fancy to get a train to Perugia

1237
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,791
Which is something that we don't own

1238
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
It's coming from the outside world

1239
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
We work on it

1240
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:39,007
And I really don't want us to be tempted somehow to keep it in cash

1241
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,799
Mila Kunis tribute

1242
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:47,711
And I would like to offer the fact that's when we get to 24 AG it's your name it'll all I can do is to work with

1243
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:51,551
To find some information on O2 bill that I shouldn't

1244
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,111
But I don't want to blow my mates

1245
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,695
Are you joining the team is starting

1246
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:02,559
Total winter break start by introducing a cash and in the States where

1247
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,583
I don't want

1248
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
Talk to me

1249
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:10,751
So if we had more time when I would like to do is to make your everything imitable the train will be meeting all the coaches will be

1250
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,543
Mirror table and the seats also

1251
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,591
Nnv only

1252
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,663
Singer called me miserable which will be there other than I should attempt

1253
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:24,063
If I was there I should have done which will be kind of entity that has a life cycle and he looked at me

1254
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:27,903
But the time change around a lot of the time

1255
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,743
At the end I will transform the other that I showed them to other version

1256
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,791
Another machine will be visible to

1257
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,863
Otherwise shown is Harrison we it's

1258
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,655
The other question

1259
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:52,735
303 Donegal sorted out

1260
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271

1261
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,807
Today outfit

1262
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,927
What I would like to maybe to 21466 to use electrical equation of operation

1263
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,719
It's ruining the clutch

1264
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,559
We have a method which is at 6 ok I can ask it to a coach

1265
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,143
But instead of meeting me the coaching Styles

1266
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,215
Well I would like to stay for that guy too rich on me

1267
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,007
The New Coach

1268
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,543
Universal suffrage

1269
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
Thought

1270
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,895
I called my son absent on the coaching staff

1271
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:24,735
All you can do is to return your Newell stores

1272
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,527
With that sits involve

1273
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:32,671
But without changing the view previous instance that when I called the assets

1274
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,439
Lytham

1275
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
So

1276
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:39,839
The benefits is super story mutability for shopping

1277
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:43,167
It's easier to move into new school County Council rates

1278
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,703
You're the coach

1279
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
10 by itself somehow

1280
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:50,847
No method on the coach which I mean you will start off of a coach

1281
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:57,503
For if I want to move that it's morning Janice the coach where related to a new type which is related to Annie

1282
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
New directions to Sawtry.

1283
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,087

1284
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Ok yeah

1285
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
In any case it's important to discuss with in America

1286
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,663

Sorry there is lots of interesting or in your head

1290
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:35,135
But yes you're right you should have some kind of discussion

1291
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,927
But

1292
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:43,839
Serious much more an implementation detail I would say

1293
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,911
It's true or False the fact that I don't want to

1294
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,495
Door instead of states relating to something that I don't

1295
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,311
I'm not under

1296

Somalia Royal concept of the domain and then make a reservation

1300
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903

01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
Yahtzee

1302
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:26,591
Yes that's not a problem

1303
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:33,759
Ok so many stone into instead of changing the culture

1304
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,319
Crittall annual soft clutch

So we can unfold define the coach seats at 1 Arena venue types

1320
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,311

01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:34,752
And does not seem to know because aggregates in science

1495
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:38,080
When do the schools need to 22222

1496
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,616
Tamiya

1497
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,272
Ed Sheeran the only running value for harvesting data training

1498
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:52,416
The I lost I do I must not exceed 70% of the 20% meat

1499
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,464
This is a museum Dundee

1500
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,816
Coach Aggregates s202

1501
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:05,728
When we discussed with the ministry after you told her that you wanted to have some new rules ready to the coach

1502
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:10,848
So that's a good enough money for funeral so I must not be here

1503
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:14,176
The giving diversity is going to change maternity

1504
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:18,528
Leggetts voice maybe it's getting better

1505
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,088
Something interesting

1506
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,416
Train coaches and seatbelt devalue types here

1507
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,720
As we discussed earlier

1508
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:31,072
If you think about the way we interact with external backend

1509
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,608
You're the kind of snapshots

1510
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,424
Venice, moment of time

1511
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,240
In we will rock on that Snapchat song

1512
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:44,640
With a wall to keep it in cash we just want to rock with all those Aggregates

1513
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,408
Francis

1514
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:51,808
So24 that we can make it all when you type so I shouldn't International

1515
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,088
That's what we did

1516
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,232
So that means that some aggregates may be completely when you type so so

1517
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,096
The train here

1518
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,192
It's most of the cases leggings with each other

1519
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:12,288
Do it was 11 days where we could have

1520
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,824
Just exception

1521
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:32,512
If you have a number you're just going to be interested because

1522
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:36,096
Maternity orangutan letter in the longest run without me do that

1523
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:39,424

Fallout 4 interactive car there is a lot of finger sister now

1527
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,896

Rifftrax and some of the other new we put it into the popular locations

1531
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,768

1532
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,792
Weather

1533
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,840
Tomorrow started

1534
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
The swap

1535
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,936
This is that we have some Jesus

1536

Respiratory telescope strings is also ageism

1539
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:26,784
What we would like to do here is to get rid of that designs train stuff

1540
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:32,416
Attributed by your husband

1541
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:36,512
That's all that's ok that my son will return a reservation

1542
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:38,048
And then

1543
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,096
On the positive side

1544
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,168

Gaza

1549
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:03,392
You don't seem that it will explain when we get back to the code

1550
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:11,328
So who is the weather for today

1551
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Ok good

1552
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:19,520
What is it going to hospital is it secure pattern made by Alistair Cockburn

I called him another day

1554
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:28,224

1555
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,784
Patel Natasha teacher 11

External dependencies plugin and play store

1560
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:45,120
Just talking about the weather system

1561
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:51,264
Ableton tuner plug with many different standards as important many different

1562
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,800
Ronaldo sock boots

1563

Broadcast news to broadcast to TV to radio to whatever

1564
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:00,224
So it was Israel and us to have a

1565
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,784
Kenneth clean code inside and

1566
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:08,160
Every changes in terms of 400 or way to interact with the system

1567
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:14,048
Premier tournaments 2017 he knew you play your pregnant and you went back up again and that's it

1568
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,936
Sorry it's come with us was introduced by that I didn't mind

1569
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:23,264
That's when we think about it babe

1570
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,616
I notice that we want to Foster on the domain to make some Cudmore

1571
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,920
Volume dealers value inside

1572
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,200
Power products

1573
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:34,784
Doing good, technical stuff

1574
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,576
I don't know for you but

1575
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:43,232
Very long time I thought it was not even possible to popular speed between domain music and and technical one week

1576
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,512
We tried many times.

1577
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:48,864
Refers to lots and in since I discovered that that Patel

1578
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,424
It's really nice way to inform that

1579
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:58,848
I also do you want Foster 72 because everything is a pluggable which unlocked

1580
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:02,688
Toaster input output of the systems

1581
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,992
This week's inside in

1582
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:08,832
So what you doing for Christmas morning how to put it on the mountain

1583
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,880
How does it work

1584
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,696
It was considering the world into

1585
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,976
Different area

1586
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:17,024
There is a inside and there is no type

1587
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,304
Sybarite

1588
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,328
No

1589
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:22,912
So the lovely girls know something to area

1590
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:30,080
The insiders of the main it showed unemployed like it I like the train station attendant

1591
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
The stuff like that

1592
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,896
Is it possible to code is at

1593
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,968
The outside of show off your system

1594
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:39,296
So this is where you will find your favourite HTTP start

1595
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:45,696
No that his rivals your message oriented middleware every solution what it is it is in cottage cheese

1596
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,096
And what we want is to Foster and to improve the Dominican

1597
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,632
So we have

1598
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:58,496
How do you know National Insurance sometimes about putting some bum boils around your bum and blood

1599
01:32:59,264 --> 01:32:59,776
N

1600
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:02,080
Defining some entry points

1601
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:05,664
29 to 20 centimetres

1602
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,688
Funny clip

1603
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:09,248
The Apostle shop good idea sign

1604
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:17,440
Nice community actually because I don't know for you better when you start your stereos Liverpool

1605
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:20,000
You need to improve your skin you need to discover new sink

1606
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,048
Need to meet new lot of mistakes

1607
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:24,096
Newton Village Hall Kinross unit

1608
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:31,008
Ul.to to realise at one point that there are some serious stuff like influence you all time rock stuff like that

1609
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:34,848
But before you focus on the on the Dunham really

1610
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:39,456
Experian Boston for some new jungle ability to be able to

1611
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:41,248
To play in the care of playground

1612
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,296
I'm ok with that

1613
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,856
As much as it does not geopandas

1614
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:50,720
The biggest value in the project and in that case I'm happy with that because there is kind of

1615
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:54,048
Location where you can play It's a playground South Hospital

1616
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:58,656
Try new technology new stuff that are members of Japan is England

1617
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,936
101

1618
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:02,496
I really like you letter is a pattern

1619
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:09,408
So how do you drop because they are ok but I need to

1620
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,688
Dementia

1621
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:14,784
To do so in terms of dependencies all dependencies afterwards inside

1622
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,856
Leeds away restaurants

1623
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,696
But of course I do we could not be aware that alright

1624
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
Any homework

1625
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:28,352
Avengers on stuff if you like that's all the domain is completely

1626
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:35,776
Independent from any kind of technology even g-strings

1627
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:39,104
So to do so tomorrow to S2

1628
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,664
Wolf from the Inside to the outside to ask

1629
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:45,760
New sing to talk with external web apis and do some stuff

1630
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,576
We will rely on personalities

1631
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,880
Lucifer

1632
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:54,464
We actually use the dependency inversion principle

1633
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:58,816
For that funding so we can go outside and do some stuff

1634
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:05,728
How do you stop a building and recently his test results remember the name and that was

1635
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,008
Suggesting the name of

1636
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,544
Configurable dependencies

1637
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:14,944
Weather is the worst thing is impossible possible I don't really like because this is like you

1638
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,016
Negative way of formulating Sainsbury's

1639
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,808
You used to do that

1640
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:22,368
Do the other way round do the inverse

1641
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:29,024
Sorry was trying to find them much more fluent intention way of saying that

1642
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,840
So they lead us to a configurable dependencies

1643
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:34,400
So you plug in and plug in your dependencies

1644
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:37,728
Randy alderman

1645
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:44,640
So if we get back to where we Ascend we have posted another talk to enter

1646
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,944
I believe the video man

1647
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,968
The box

1648
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:52,832
Dirhams to the demand and there are some interfaces like a lollipop here

1649
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:56,928
So here I've got sizes of Suits which is the entry point from the

1650
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,464
From the clipper system

1651

Adaptor

1771
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,736
Ok

1772
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:18,112
Step one instance of the dependencies I need to go to the outside world

1773
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:21,696
Then what I need is to associate

1774
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,000
Zigzag

1775
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,560
So the attack on here is a web ticket manager

1776
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,584
So let's

1777
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,120

01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:53,440
And then instead of going directly the lagoon

1785
01:42:54,208 --> 01:43:00,352
All I said before is the application would have to interact with my biometrics

1786
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:02,656
IPhone adaptor so let's introduce it

1787
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:04,704
Supreme

1788
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,520
Interested I want to go in adaptor so here

1789
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:10,592
I can do is to what how can we then use it

1790

1796
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,712
Ticket manager

1797

Maybe is on the web ticket manager here

1800
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:06,400

1801
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,680
Adana CI
